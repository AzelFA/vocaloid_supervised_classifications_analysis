734953,,sV2H712ldOI,@alexender2695,"Dear God, I've come to repent my sins
Let your blood wash me clean for I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm a rotten girl

I swore I'd never sin again
But my patience's running thin
The temptation flowing through my veins
I'm bounded by these shackles of shame
I promised I'd indulge no more
But my heart I can't ignore
In my dreams they're turning up the heat
I'm a dirty, rotten girl

On lock, underneath the bleachers
Just watch, look beyond the smoke and mirrors
Heartstruck? Shun the nunbeliever
Our operation would never be complete
Red hot! Tension with each whisper
Snapshot! Quiet moans and muffled whimpers
Come on! Can't you feel the fever
Rising up? Rising up to the sky?

As testaments echo, fear ignites beneath my skin
The lord sayeth, halt thy child, don't give into sin
It's driving me crazy
The urge to forsake thee
Yet, something shifts within this wicked bliss

I swore I'd never sin again
But my patience's running thin
Student council breathing down my neck
I wonder if they're hiding from me
Forbidden fruits before my eyes
And a taste that's so divine
My regrets rewriting history
I'm a sad, pathetic girl

Someone please tell me what to do
Because honestly, I just can't stop!
I've been trying so hard and I can't stop!
What would God think?!
And- I- I know I'm supposed to be a good girl, but
Somehow I just can't control myself
Every time I see them
Touching skin to skin
My mind goes
My mind goes
Kyaa-ah

Could Eve be our idol?
Could she lead us through the light?
We'd all be disciples of her lemon driven bite
Can somebody save me?
The urge to forsake thee
Still, something shifts within this wicked bliss

The power resting in my hands
For my God has other plans
In salvation I can live my life
As an ordinary girl

I can't resist it anymore
'Cause I smell slow burn galore
All the trauma from a cobblestone
Could never beat the devil in me
An honest sinner till I die
What's the harm if I don't mind?
With the paddle that empowers me
I can live a sinful life",2025-05-30T13:31:48Z,0,en

The shame and guilt of having lustful desires... if society did not shun people for having such natural desires, such people would not go to such lengths to indulge. Healthy communication and learning would make erotic material a non-issue. There is nothing wrong with having an instinctual need to... indulge, shall we say. It is programmed into our very DNA. Of course there needs to be limitations, but to consider someone a 'sinner' or a 'perv' simply because they indulge... seems like complete nonsense, or perhaps something more sinister, but I'll not spew more thoughts of that type. If you read this, do not be ashamed to like dirty things.

I remember a few months ago that I was humming this tune, and my friend was looking at me suspiciously like I was casting the most unfathomable spell. They asked me if I ever listened to the ""Confessions of a Rotten Girl, and I was taken aback, because that's just not something you just say regardless of how close you are with someone. I guess my friend realized that they forgot to mention that they ment a song, or Miku, or even vocaloid, because they too became flustered from embarrassment (or shame). 

Let me tell you the truth. I was humming this song, but not because I heard the whole thing, but because I watched a Short that had this song. I watched a mini video that was a duet battle between this little Otaku Miku and Kapi the Cat(think Friday Night Funkin mods). 

Beethoven would be shaken in his boots by his modern fans: Furries, Otakus, Game Developers, Vocaloid Artists.",2025-05-24T17:06:03Z,1,en

I'm...
I̴͉̠̒̿́͒̈́͗'̵̟̘̯̼̯͇̒m̸̧̘̈̌.̷͎̪̜̹͝.̵͎̼̩̌͆͑́͌́.̵̛̺̌̒̆
I'm a rotten girl...

I swore I'd never sin again
But my patience's running thin...
The temptation flowing through my veins
I'm bounded by these shackles of shame...

I promised I'd indulge no more
But my heart I can't ignore ♥
In my dreams they're turning up the heat
I'm a dirty, rotten girl...

On lock, underneath the bleachers
Just watch, look beyond the smoke & mirrors
Heartstruck?! Shun the nunbeliever!
Our operation would NEVER be complete

Red Hot! Tension with each whisper
Snapshot! Quiet moans and muffled whimpers
Come on! Can't you feel the fever~
Rising up?! Rising up to the sky?!

As testaments echo, fear ignites beneath my skin
The lord sayeth, halt thy child, don't give into sin
It's driving me crazy
The urge to forsake thee
Yet, something shifts within this wicked bliss

I swore I'd never sin again
But my patience's running thin...
Student council breathing down my neck

I wonder if they're hiding from me...
Forbidden fruits before my eyes
And a taste that's so divine
My regrets rewriting history
I'm a sad, pathetic girl

Someone PLEASE tell me what to do...
Because...
HONESTLY, I just can't STOP!!
I've been trying so hard and I can't STOPPPP---!

WHAT WOULD GOD THINK?!?!
and- I-
I know I'm supposed to be a good girl, but...
SOMEHOW I JUST CAN'T CONTROL MYSELF...

Everytime I see them...
Touching skin to skin..........
My mind goes-
MY MIND GOES---
KYAAaAAAaAAAAAa4rftfgsdAAA----

Could Eve be our idol?
Could she lead us through the light?
We'd all be disciples of her lemon[2] driven bite

Can somebody save me?
The urge to forsake thee
Still, something shifts within this wicked bliss

-The power resting in my hands
-For my God has other plans
-In salvation I can live my life
-As an ordinary girl

I can't resist it anymore
'Cause I smell slow burn galore
All the trauma from a cobblestone
Could never beat the devil in me

An honest sinner 'till I die
What's the harm if I don't mind?
With the paddle that empowers me
I can live a sinful life",2025-05-24T00:53:28Z,0,en

734953,,sV2H712ldOI,@ESPSOLO-th9kr,"ミクの福音の理解は間違っています。

福音は、全人類、全世界のすべての罪が、私たちの罪の赦しのためにイエス・キリストに負われたと述べています。イエスが過去に十字架につけられたのであれば、それは将来の罪も含むことを意味します。イエスが肉体を持った神として、贖罪のために死んだことを信じる瞬間、あなたは死から命へと移ります。

「神は、その独り子をお与えになったほどに、世を愛された。独り子を信じる者が一人も滅びないで、永遠の命を得るためである。」（ヨハネによる福音書 3:16）

「まことに、まことに、あなたがたに告げます。わたしを信じる者は（今という意味です）永遠の命を持っています。」（ヨハネによる福音書 6:47）

決して罪を犯さないと言うことは、福音の目的ではありません。もし罪を犯したとしても、それは赦されますが、私たちは理由もなく罪を犯そうとすべきではありません。コリント人への第一の手紙 5:5 は、全く悔い改めない罪を犯した者は懲罰を受けることができることを示しています。「あなたたちはこの人をサタンに引き渡し、肉を滅ぼし、彼の霊が主の日に救われるようにしなさい。」

決して失われるとは述べられていません…

神は決して私たちを追い出したり、失ったりすることはありません。
ヨハネによる福音書 6:37 「…わたしに来る者を、わたしは決して追い出さない。」

ヨハネによる福音書 6:39 「わたしを遣わした父の御心は、父がわたしに与えてくださったものを、わたしが一人も失わないようにすることである。」

もし私たちが天の父に従うなら、この世に愛、喜び、平和、そして幸福がもたらされます。ローマ人への手紙 6:16、ガラテヤ人への手紙 5:22-23

もし私たちが天の父に従わなければ、父は私たちを罰（懲らしめ）ますが、私たちの罰が地獄になることは決してありません。神は、父が子供たちを扱うように私たちを扱われます。箴言 3:11-12、コリント第一 11:32、ヘブル人への手紙 12:5-7

肉は罪を犯しますが、霊は新しくされます。ですから、私たちも心を新たにすべきです。しかし、それには時間がかかることもあります。

ミクが自分をコントロールし、多くの人が神の子となることを願っています。",2025-05-12T00:05:15Z,1,ja

793121,,KlTNKOnfXFk,@lumimaruu,"Probably a detail someone pointed out, but if you play the song around 2:55 - 2:56, you can see a few frames of Miku looking worried, as if she's aware that the viewer (or viewers,) is leaving her during that moment. The final frame before the glitching stops shows Miku facing away; I personally think this is Miku going to sit down, waiting for the viewer to return, as when it cuts back to her, she is sitting down before realizing the viewer is back.
(Clarifying, these frames are before she starts talking about how she hopes the viewer won't leave for long, or change the channel.)

EDIT: When Miku repeats ""Now and forever,"" you can see a single frame of her with TV sets. It looks like she's crying, to me. Another frame shows her with crayons, Miku is holding a red crayon and a green one is broken.

Another edit: I'm pretty sure someone else mentioned this, but there's a frame (around when Miku says ""Just stay here a while with me"" a second time,) that shows a realistic-like miku. Another one shows Miku with balloons.",2025-06-03T18:31:05Z,1,en

Such a classic melody
One two three, you know the words
So sing along with me!

One two three, motley scenes
Shining through the silver screen
One two three, dontcha think
This is how it ought to be?

Just another day, throw your cares away
And laugh hand-in-hand with me!
Just another day,
Just another day,
It’sjustanotherdayit’sjustanotherdayit's–

One two three, what’s the nicest thing you see?
It’s me!!!!!!!!!!

The world you know, always running to and fro
A frightful place to be
But don’t be scared, I’m not going anywhere!
So just don’t touch the dial and stay here awhile with me!

Panic! In static! Out-manic!
Don’t you find it all romantic, the way things used to be?
Classic, ecstatic, it’s magic
To trip the light fantastic, repeat it after me!

This is how it should be, in studio seats
My ego wired in the CRT
We can skip the sign-off
Ol' familiar scene, repeating
This is how it should be!

One two three, sing with me
It’s a catchy melody
ABC, it sounds so sweet
When you sing along with me!

Four five six, check the script?
Keep your harmony in-key
Ten nine eight, for the sake
Of the way it ought to be

Just another day, throw your cares away
And laugh hand-in-hand with me!
Just another day, just another day of
Keeping our company!

Who cares what people say, we’ll stay another day in revelry, reverie!
Always be together, fair and stormy weather
Never growing older, never growing colder
Always be together, now and for forever
evereverevereverevereverever-

One two three, who’s the brightest star you see?
It’s me.

The world you know never seems to take it slow
A tiring pace indeed
So don’t delay, I’ll be here to save the day
Just please don’t touch the dial
Just stay here a while with me

Panic! In static! Out-manic!
Don’t you find it all romantic, the way things used to be?
Classic, ecstatic, it’s magic
To trip the light fantastic, repeat it after me!

This is how it should be, in studio seats
My ego wired in the CRT
We can skip the sign-off
Ol' familiar scene, repeating
This is how it should be!

When you go,
Just don’t change the channel
I hope you won’t be long

After all
I want to be wanted
Is that so wrong?

Panic! In static! Out-manic!
Don’t you find it all romantic, the way things used to be?
Classic, ecstatic, it’s magic
To trip the light fantastic, repeat it after me!

This is how it should be, in studio seats
My ego wired in the CRT
We can skip the sign-off

This is how it should be!

And laugh hand-in-hand with me!

A frightful place to be
But don’t be scared, I’m not going anywhere!
So just don’t touch the dial and stay here awhile with me!

Panic! In static! Out-manic!
Don’t you find it all romantic, the way things used to be?
Classic, ecstatic, it’s magic
To trip the light fantastic, repeat it after me!

This is how it should be, in studio seats
My ego wired in the CRT
We can skip the sign-off
Ol' familiar scene, repeating
This is how it should be!

One two three, sing with me
It’s a catchy melody
ABC, it sounds so sweet
When you sing along with me!

Four five six, check the script?
Keep your harmony in-key
Ten nine eight, for the sake
Of the way it ought to be

Just another day, throw your cares away
And laugh hand-in-hand with me!
Just another day, just another day of
Keeping our company!

Who cares what people say, we’ll stay another day in revelry, reverie!
Always be together, fair and stormy weather
Never growing older, never growing colder
Always be together, now and for forever
evereverevereverevereverever-

One two three, who’s the brightest star you see?
It’s me.

A tiring pace indeed
So don’t delay, I’ll be here to save the day
Just please don’t touch the dial
Just stay here a while with me

Just don’t change the channel
I hope you won’t be long

In 1:30 to 1:40 Miku misses the number 7, and 7 means lucky or heavenly... Won't this mean something???
Also in the scene 1:58 to 2:00 where it glitches, Miku is shown with 5 televisions, one of them being on her head. That could link to the CRT...
Also at exactly 2:28 when it glitches yet again, Miku is seen, scared. She has a face like :| and her eyes are open wide, eyebrows in a frightened state.
AND at 2:55 or 2:56 Miku is again shown scared.
AAAAND at 3:29 Miku is shown SCARED YET AGAIN, seriously what is wrong with this song and scared faces???
In 1:37, I can't describe what Miku is holding, but it's some orange stuff and then flowers on it with the flowers fading away... Doesn't that mean something of the song name being Static?
And at 1:37 again, Miku is shown with 6 books in one of each color: Red, Green, Blue, Pink, Cyan and White. If you include black and white, it's the CRT ""Static/Error"" colors!
At 1:06 [66 seconds, and 666 is the demon number...] Miku says ""it's magic"" which means the devil is magical... HOW DID I FIND THIS-
At 0:05 to 0:25 Miku says ""1,2,3"" 3 times, if we do 1+2+3 that equals 6. If she said it 3 times, then its 666 - the demon's number.
Final one I'm doing - At 1:31 Miku is shown grabbing a red phone, when there's blue, green, yellow, cyan and pink colors aswell. It's on a red table and Miku seems to be standing infront of it to our sight, as her hand is behind the bottom of the table on our viewpoint.",2025-06-02T19:34:03Z,4,en

Also in many scenes for a spilt second it shows her looking panicked for example “2:27” i think it’s because someone scrolled off her channel or she’s nervous the person watching could scroll any second. I also believe that when someone stops watching she either disappears which i think im wrong about or gets stranded in a black void like it the start of the video and at “2:04” until someone comes across her, which is why she’s so desperate to get you to stay. In a split second it shows her in a black void looking more serious than she did when the viewer was watching. Ok lastly this may sound like im insane but just listen, at 1:53 it zooms in not giving the 1980’s look and in those years many serious things didn’t happen meaning dire situations didn’t happen and as it zooms in it give a more 1990-2000s or modern look and as things got more modern in those years more serious situations happened over time and to summarize the screen zooms in at 1:53 telling you it gets more serious because most people would have scrolled by now and she thinks you may scroll also, after this scene it returns to the 1980s look which i think it means she calms down because you haven’t scrolled to another channel and you won’t leave her.",2025-06-02T03:37:18Z,3,en

793121,,KlTNKOnfXFk,@oksure9261,"Notes:

The studio seats Miku continues referring to are completely empty, yet she displays them proudly with a spotlight regardless, seemingly obsessed with the idea that they *used* to be full.

Near the beginning, in the first glitch, Miku begins repeating the words ""It's just another day"" twice in quick succession. I think this because she feels as though each consecutive day is continuing on faster, without her. Also, I think it's her trying to be convince herself that nothing's changed, just another day of being beloved.

During the 2:00 glitch, two scenes stand out; Miku on the floor, drawing on the floor with multicolor crayons. Several seem to be broken. As well, Miku standing behind an arch of multicolored televisions. Looking closely, I think she may be crying? Not really smart enough to analyze the first scene, but if I'm right about what's happening in the second, the meaning is clear.

At 1:50, the aspect ratio increases so as to contain the lyrics, from what I assume is the antiquated 4:3 to what I assume is modern 16:9, what I see as an attempt to modernize to some degree so as to maintain relevance, albeit in a very shallow way.",2025-06-02T00:20:11Z,1,en

793121,,KlTNKOnfXFk,@enigmaticalarrias7684,"I love this song so much for a myriad of reasons (the music is a banger, the style is so cute with dips into unsettling moments, many of the analystic comments), but one I noticed is how it references old syles of tv media over the decades!!
The biggest one is Miku's appearance itself, she looks veey much like the ""UPA Style"", which was a late 1940's/early 1950's graphic style, made to contrast the more 'realistic' style of Disney and Warner Bros. animation, with it's stronger emphasis on shapes than anatomy. She even has key points of cutoffs- big bowtie, large cuffs, and big skirt, which in the original UPA style was done to seperate the cells so the focal point of animation can be done seperately to save time/money as opposed to animating the whole character (characters like The Flinstones or Yogi Bear are examples of this, look to the latter with his collar and tie). Her more animated movements and smear frames is much more like the ""UPA revival"" era from the 1990's/2000's, with shows like PPG and Dexter's Lab where advancements in tech and more money being invested into TV cartoons allowed for more dynamic movement. The backgrounds are more abstract with little to no outlines, looking more like overlayed cutouts- very common in UPA styles and better defines the characters.
Miku both mentions and leans on a CRT TV, one of the earliest forms of a TV set. Big, boxy, glass screens you can feel the static from if it was on. The early commercial CRT TVs were made in 1934, with a boom post WW2, though TVs existed since late 1920's, and cathode ray tubes were first proven to used to display images in 1897! CRT TVs held strong for many decades until the 2000's, when flat screen TVs, plasma or LCD make, started taving over.
Early in the song Miku mentions the ""silver screen"", a common nickname for cinemas and theaters, which is how many cartoons were watched before TVs became widespread. People would purchase tickets to watch Disney, Warner Bros, or Universal animations this way, and why you can find many old posters advertising classic shorts. And it can go back even farther, with theater production bring one of the oldest forms of entertainment!
In the chorus Miku mentions studio seats and the sign off, both relating to old broadcasting, though both still continue in practice. Studio seats refer to the in-studio audience of people watching the production of shows, skits, and news reports, and can go back further for radio shows. Studio seats can also refer to the ones runing the production, but the case for the song it's heavy on the audience aspect. Sign off refers to when before TV stations pucked up 24 hour broadcasting in the 1980's-90's (though not every channel), there were notifications of when the channel was closing for the night, in forms of an annoucement, a montage, or a test pattern (color bars or the ""Please Stand By"" image) before static took over. Typically this was done because the transmitter equiment needed maintinence.

Realising all of this, these nods also tie into the themes of static both song-wise and theme-wise. Food for thought!",2025-06-01T19:06:42Z,9,en

793121,,KlTNKOnfXFk,@Frankie-Thunderkitten,"Something that I really love about this song is that, much like Welcome Home and other media in this genre, is that it never goes into hardcore horror, even when I’m really expecting it. There’s no ‘haha nostalgic childhood thing turns scary gottem!’, no jumpscare, no big and flashy reveal, just the tragedy of something being very wrong that the characters are trying to tell you about, but they know you’re watching and don’t want to push you away, so they can’t be too scary, just unsettling. And in the unsettling moments, the art and overall vibe is used as a cover of sorts so the horror is lost on the viewers. In fact, they might be using the horrors of these situations to get your attention - it has to be just ‘off’ enough so that you’ll be intrigued, stay, and (maybe) help them.

Also, I love how the entire song lasts 4:04 minutes, as in a 404 error, implying that this cartoon is a piece of lost media and you weren’t even supposed to FIND it, much less watch it (not that Miku cares or even realizes - for all she knows viewership on her show has simply gone done)",2025-06-01T17:56:52Z,2,en

Such a classic melody
One two three, you know the words
So sing along with me!

One two three, motley scenes
Shining through the silver screen
One two three, dontcha think
This is how it ought to be?

Just another day, throw your cares away
And laugh hand-in-hand with me!
Just another day,
Just another day,
It’sjustanotherdayit’sjustanotherdayit's–

One two three, what’s the nicest thing you see?
It’s me!!!!!!!!!!

The world you know, always running to and fro
A frightful place to be
But don’t be scared, I’m not going anywhere!
So just don’t touch the dial and stay here awhile with me!

Panic! In static! Out-manic!
Don’t you find it all romantic, the way things used to be?
Classic, ecstatic, it’s magic
To trip the light fantastic, repeat it after me!

This is how it should be, in studio seats
My ego wired in the CRT
We can skip the sign-off
Ol' familiar scene, repeating
This is how it should be!

One two three, sing with me
It’s a catchy melody
ABC, it sounds so sweet
When you sing along with me!

Four five six, check the script?
Keep your harmony in-key
Ten nine eight, for the sake
Of the way it ought to be

Just another day, throw your cares away
And laugh hand-in-hand with me!
Just another day, just another day of
Keeping our company!

Who cares what people say, we’ll stay another day in revelry, reverie!
Always be together, fair and stormy weather
Never growing older, never growing colder
Always be together, now and for forever
evereverevereverevereverever-

One two three, who’s the brightest star you see?
It’s me.

The world you know never seems to take it slow
A tiring pace indeed
So don’t delay, I’ll be here to save the day
Just please don’t touch the dial
Just stay here a while with me

Panic! In static! Out-manic!
Don’t you find it all romantic, the way things used to be?
Classic, ecstatic, it’s magic
To trip the light fantastic, repeat it after me!

This is how it should be, in studio seats
My ego wired in the CRT
We can skip the sign-off
Ol' familiar scene, repeating
This is how it should be!

When you go,
Just don’t change the channel
I hope you won’t be long

After all
I want to be wanted
Is that so wrong?

Panic! In static! Out-manic!
Don’t you find it all romantic, the way things used to be?
Classic, ecstatic, it’s magic
To trip the light fantastic, repeat it after me!

This is how it should be, in studio seats

We can skip the sign-off

793121,,KlTNKOnfXFk,@whythis2341,"I'm a little late but for people who may not be familiar, it's an Osomatsu san reference! The show is a comedy, essentially about sextuplets refusing to grow up, become proper adults, and move on with their lives, grappling to the fame of their original show back in 1980s. Here's a break down of some of the references.

- There's a voice clip of the show where they say ""This is how it should be."" or ""Kore de ii no da"" on 2:27 The line in english was also repeated multiple times in the song as the motif. 6 also is a reoccurring number (6 Mikus, 6 seats being lit up).

- There's 2 main color order in this video: The first is red cyan green indigo yellow and pink. This one is simple, it's their birth order of each of the brothers, which is Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jyushimatsu, and Todomatsu in that order. Appears most commonly in the chorus where she signs out DON'T GO in sailor body language. We will get to the other order later, as that goes into spoilers.

- In the Japanese captions, the first half of each of the brother's names appeared briefly in hiragana or katakana before changing into kanji or hiragana. Oso on 0:49 , Kara on 1:12 , Choro on 2:09 , Ichi on 1:09 , Jyushi on 0:59 , and Todo on 1:51

- This is huge spoilers territory, but there is an episode that deviates from their usual comedy into a more somber tone, where one of them landed a job and ended up moving out, causing the rest of the brothers to follow suit, except for the title character, Osomatsu, who has the most trouble grappling with moving on with his life to the point of becoming apathetic and ended up staying home, he is represented by the color red. Miku in some of the shots is holding the red object (The books, the cards, and the crayons), sometimes entirely absent from the objects (TVs), and red is the background of all of these shots. Red here is meant to represent Osomatsu who refused to let go and is struggling to cling onto the past, like Miku.

- The second order of colors in those 1 frame shots is Green Pink Cyan Yellow and Indigo, with Miku holding onto the red (The books stack from top to bottom and the cards from right to left). This represents the order each of the brothers left. Choromatsu, represented by Green, leaving was the inciting incident, and thus comes first, and it's also why the Green crayon is broken. Todomatsu, Karamatsu, Jyushimatsu, and Ichimatsu eventually followed, as they couldn't handle Osomatsu's refusal to accept change.



There are a few more straight forward references such as Miku's outfit being very similar to their suits, and the song being posted on the sextuplet's birthday, but the ones I listed are the most prominent ones.",2025-06-01T16:18:28Z,245,en

An entirely that only appears in things that reflect who takes the form of someone’s favorite character. And tries to calm one down by making them visit the past in their mind. Slowly making them come back more and more until they’re put into a mental state where they are literally stuck in the past and being tortured by it.

You're a Super Superhero

Your level's gotten too high, you no longer understand
What it feels like to be a small fry
What it feels like to be a small fry
You've reached the top, you no longer relate
To songs written for the weak
To songs written for the weak

Your IQ, your physical abilities, your connections, your looks
The strongest, the greatest, World is mine
I'm scared beyond impressed, I'm scared beyond impressed
Cheers to friendship, effort, and victory
You want it all and become loved
Your eyes are kinda creepy

You're no longer the person I once knew

You're super, you're awesome,  living your psychopathic ideal life 
You're super, you're awesome,  telling success stories no one’s asked for
You're super, you're awesome, going easy on your own sins
You're super…Really? I'm super?

""Oops, did I do something again?""

Super, Super, Superhero, Super, Super, Superhero
Surrounded by lambs who want to be like you
Super, Super, Superhero, Super, Super, Superhero
Secretly getting rid of mobs that get in your way
Hey, the next thing I know,
You've become a villain, haven't you?

Superhero or DIE What? Superhero or DIE
Superhero or DIE What?
Superhero or DIE What? Superhero or DIE
You're a Super Superhero

You're a Hero Hero Hero  
Full of light, there's no room for shadows
Fight for Justice Justice Justice
For a brighter future, sacrifices must be made

So, you're going the stereotypical way?

You're super, you're awesome, forcing your one-sided love on others
You're super, you're awesome, surrounding yourself with a bunch of yes-men
You're super, you're awesome, justifying your uncontrollable egos
You're great, ...Hey, shut up,

""Perhaps you're an enemy, too?""

Super, Super, Superhero, Super, Super, Superhero
Surrounded by followers who worship you
Super, Super, Superhero, Super, Super, Superhero
What's left after you've achieved everything?
Hey, isn't that nice outfit
Dyed by the blood of your enemies?

Super, Super, Superhero, Super, Super, Superhero
So it's super, super, super
Even if you destroy the world --huh!?

Super, Super, Superhero, Super, Super, Superhero
Surrounded by lambs who are frightened by you
Super, Super, Superhero, Super, Super, Superhero
Eliminating each and every mob that gets in your way
Hey, the next thing I know,
You've become the Supervillain, haven't you?
Defeated by the next Superhero, goodbye

「 いいよ いいよ サイコにキラキラしちゃって 」

文脈的に「最高にキラキラしちゃって」って意味だと思ってたから、『最高』でも『サイコウ』でもなく、『サイコ』なのが妙に引っかかってた。

英語字幕見てみたら、
「Living your psychopathic ideal life」　
（サイコパス的な理想の生活を送る）

だったから、ここの『サイコ』は『最高』でもなんでもなくって、『サイコパス』を意味する『サイコ』だったんだなってめっちゃ納得した。",2025-05-30T11:50:28Z,0,ja

749433,,thmR2SmkeDU,@le_roi_renard,"I do have a theory that this song is also about toxic fans who don't accept that their idol becomes more outspoken on political matters, or their idols changing to become ""woke"", and the moment their idol started displaying such behaviours they immediately try to discredit them by painting them as a ""villain"", while flocking to another ""hero"" after said ""hero"" cancelled their former idol. And the cycle repeats.

Or in other words this song is about fans who want their idols to simply ""shut up and entertain us"" while ignoring that their idols are human beings who can change, clinging onto their ideal images of them and deciding to dump them afterwards when it's clear that there's no going back. Think, popular artists or VTubers, or even celebrities like Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, who started off as not saying much about political matters and/or not being ""woke"". But the moment they ""got the woke mind virus"" their entire fanbase turned their back on them, basically acting like ""you no longer cater to us"", ""you no longer relate to us"", ""there's no place for darkness"",... And thus they harassed the idol to the point the idol quits (or even worse, killing themselves) and they flock to another one, proclaiming them to be their ""hero"". Hence, ""SuperHERO or DIE"", either you be our ""superhero"", either you stay who you are supposed to be, your same old ignorant self, you shut up and sing, you stay our circus monkey,... or you die.

At least that's my two cents to it.

EDIT: After revisiting another song of his, ""Magical Girl and Chocolate"", I feel like these two songs can be antitheses to each other, one is about the toxic fans who wanted their idols to behave in a certain way for them, to ""shut up and sing"", while the other is about said idol who got sick of how those so-called ""fans"" treated them they decided to call it quits, or even worse, killing themselves.
Plus, the two songs' BPMs are nearly the same, Magical Girl and Chocolate being 150 and this song being 155, which further shows the feeling of the idol being ""out of touch"" with their fans.",2025-04-02T01:38:09Z,4,en

Obviously there's an artistic reason behind this, so they can have both appearances swap seamlessly in the video, but it also shows how very little actually *changed* about her other than how she was perceived. It makes sense; since the beginning of the song, she's singing about how she's disconnected from the masses, while actively destroying the little chibi versions of her which represent the masses.",2025-03-28T12:28:41Z,26,en

石化

教科書じゃ「生き物はみな平等に尊厳がある」
とあるが実際 意識が他者にあるか とか証明不可能
固まった顔 固まった所作 ワードチョイス
固まった反応 固まった将来 & 行為
まるで意志などない石 タンパク製人形

プラスターと化した顔　プラスターと化した心
本音は怒ってるの 泣いてるの 笑ってるの 病んでるの

過剰に適応 絡み合う蛇のような輪っかの中
適度な距離 保てなく 事なかれで 尊厳硬化
あっちゅう間に石化していく人相
Everybody like a freezing stone
この世界は石化してないほうがモンスターなの？  

どうして固まっちゃうの
どうしてパターン化しちゃうの
この眼に 生きた笑顔を 生きた涙を 映したい

プラスターと化した顔　プラスターと化した心 
本音は怒ってるの 泣いてるの 笑ってるの 病んでるの
顔面蒼白オンリー
不安しか無い真っさら　不安しか無いのっぺら
安全に均した滑らかな 灰色の大陸の中
君の歪を探してる

748682,,isXoiYfoDd8,@blueseraph8618,"My autistic ass analyzed the lyrics to Gorgon so here's my interpretation 

""Dissolve the stone""

Reminds me of masking where you pretend to be normal and hide your disability under a normal facade, so ""breaking the stone"" means not masking and being true to yourself

This lyric ties into the theme of expressionless statues and not showing your true self that's underneath the stone

""Break free of the evil eye"" is really interesting to me. I think it's talking about how some people get over their fear of judgment from others that leaves them exposed, aka the ""evil eye"" 

It sounds like something from the perspective of someone with autism who can't read other people's emotions and feelings very well and yearns to stop masking and break free of judgment",2025-04-20T15:03:50Z,3,en

Feels like the week has just begun
(The old routine, everything’s the same it ever was)
Broken and battered
Saturday calls behind the sun
(Come on, come on, come and have some fun!)

Clock out from the same old crowd
Put down the old life you knew before, and shout!
We living, so get loud!
From sunset to sunrise, our hearts will never die
‎
Bouncing bass lines I adore
Calling from the dancefloor
Blinding scenes precede new feelings
I’ve never known before

'til the morning trip the light
Let these feelings take flight
Now I'm singing like
nanananana
‎
Let's party!
Let's part the sun and the sea
Got our names on the marquee
Bewitching electric dreams
Abstract with me!

Forget that nine to five
Hell of fluorescent lights
Apollo sneaks a sign
Between monotony’s reply

Wanna feel alive
The pyre’s will ignites
Between the sunset and sunrise
This night will never die
‎
Bump that beat and we can soar
Right over the dancefloor
Blinding scenes precede new feelings
I’ve never known before

Till the morning trip the light
Let these feelings take flight
Now I'm singing like
nanananana
‎
Let's party!
Let's part the sun and the sea
Got our names on the marquee

In early mornings, 
Feels like the week has just begun
( the old routine , everything’s the same it ever was ) 
Broken and battered , 
Saturday calls behind the sun
( come on , come on! Come and have some fun! )
Clock out, from the same old crowd 
Put down , the old life you knew before
And shout!
We living so, get loud
From sunset > to sunrise ,
Our hearts will never die….
Bouncing baselines , I adore 
Calling from the dance floor , 
Blinding scenes precede 
New feelings , I’ve never known before
Till the morning, trip the light 
Let these feelings take flight 
Now im singing like 
( nah nah nah )
Let’s party! 
Let’s part the sun and the sea!
Got our names on the marque!
Bewitching electric dreams,
Abstract with me!
( instrumental )
Forget that nine to five ,
Hell of fluorescent lights ,
 Apollo sneaks a sign ,
Between monotony’s reply 
Wanna feel alive,
The dyres will ignites,
Between the sunset and sunrise
This night will never die.
( let’s go :3 )
Pump that beat and we can soar!
Right over the dance floor!
Blinding scenes precede ,
New feelings , I’ve never known before,
Till the morning trip the light 
Let these feeling take flight
Now im singing like,
( nah nah nah nah )
Let’s party! Let’s part the sun and the sea!
Got our names on the marquee! ( yeah ! )
Bewitching electric dreams 
We’re just getting started!
Oh started!
( woah woah woah woah )
Get started! Yeah started!
Bewitching electric dreams , 
Abstract with me!

750840,,lOwCUMprBoY,@jestingjes,"ELECTRIC WEEKEND ZONE Lyrics

﻿In early mornings
Feels like the week has just begun
(The old routine, everything’s the same it ever was)


Broken and battered
Saturday calls behind the sun
(Come on, come on, come and have some fun!)


Clock out from the same old crowd
Put down the old life you knew before, and shout!
We’re living, so get loud!
From sunset to sunrise our hearts will never die


Bouncing basslines I adore
Calling from the dancefloor
Blinding scenes precede new feelings
I’ve never known before 


Till the morning trip the light
Let these feelings take flight
Now I'm singing like
nanananana


Let's party (Whoa Oh Oh)
Let's part the sun and the sea
Got our names on the marquee (Whoa Oh Oh)
Bewitching electric dreams
Abstract with me!


Forget that nine to five
Hell of fluorescent lights
Apollo sneaks a sign
Between monotony’s reply


Wanna feel alive
The pyre’s will ignites
Between the sunset and sunrise
This night will never die


Bump that beat and we can soar
Right over the dancefloor
Blinding scenes precede new feelings
I’ve never known before 


Till the morning trip the light
Let these feelings take flight
Now I'm singing like
nanananana


Let's party (Whoa Oh Oh)
Let's part the sun and the sea
Got our names on the marquee (Whoa Oh Oh)
Bewitching electric dreams


We’re just getting started,
Oh started
Woah oh oh woah oh oh
Started, yeah started


Bewitching electric dreams

like i don't really find the corresponding song to be particularly sexual or very inappropriate but it is funny that people get mad at a group of ""westeners"" for finding something uncomfortable and feeling like they should make a good song that is straight sounding out of the 2010s and simultaneously a 'response' song",2025-02-20T05:40:22Z,17,en

Also, will you people stop parasocially associating the real-life voice provider with this stuff? Have you for a second stopped and considered how it might affect her if she saw how the fandom is forcing an association of her love of cats as a symbol for ""anti CSA""? She never asked for this. Ultimately, I can't control what people do with a fictional character, but leave her real-life counterpart (and her interests) alone. 

In your crusade to ""purify"" the image of Yuki, you're making everything worse with your black-and-white thinking. I know the Japanese side isn't without fault either, but this is quite literally the worst way to go about it.",2025-02-19T02:18:35Z,13,en

747700,,ZaZhdZl0coU,@PeggyWhynowhy,"This song hurts a lot, but in a very cathartic way. Different from how the other song hurt, in a way that made old wounds sting worse. It's astounding how quickly you were able to make this, and it's brave. This is a subject often shunned and silenced despite how many people who grew up in anime and vocaloid-adjacent communities online had to live it. ""You still laugh thinking that it's funny, there's many people who would hate to see me like this""

Despite this, part of me is still torn by the usage of a real child's voice being used here.  I think it all just comes back to the ethics of a voicebank of a child existing at all, and not your fault. It isn't really something I considered until this entire debacle (hell I kinda forgot Kaai Yuki existed). Can a child consent to having their voice used for anything and everything the same way an adult can? Of course, there is certain terms of use for this exact reason. My feelings on it are pretty gray.

At the end of the day though, this song still struck a chord with me and I thank you for it regardless.",2025-02-10T02:54:19Z,108,en

Zako Zako Zako Zako
A worthless existence, pitiful
Zako Zako Zako Zako
Zako's zako attacks don't work
Zako

[Verse 1: Akita Neru]
Zako Zako Zako Zako
Too weak Zako, really Zako
Too weak, it's out of the question
You want to be called Zako Zako, you're a pervert
Zako

Elliot James Raey ""I Think They Call This Love"" Lyrics & Meaning | Genius Verified

[Pre-Chorus: Akita Neru]
Pathetic Zako, poor Zako
A worthless existence, Zako

[Chorus: Kasane Teto]
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako

[Post-Chorus: Akita Neru]
Shall I pat you on the head?
Our eyes met, I'm so excited.
What are you imagining? That's so gross.
Are you jealous? What the hell is that, you idiot - the lowest level
weak trash -
but I really love you, I really love you
it's a lie, you're cute

[Refrain: Kasane Teto, Akita Neru]
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako (is that annoying?)
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako (pervert)

[Verse 2: Akita Neru]
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako
You're probably bored anyway, so treat me
Too idiot, it's out of the question
You'll be alone when you get home anyway
Zako

[Pre-Chorus: Akita Neru]
Pathetic Zako Poor Zako
I'm a hopeless pervert

[Chorus: Kasane Teto]
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako

[Post-Chorus: Akita Neru]
Shall I give you a good boy?
Our eyes met, I'm so excited.
What are you so excited about? It's so gross.
Are you jealous?
What the hell is that? - the lowest level
Weak trash -
But I really like you, I really like you.
I'm kidding, you're cute.

[Bridge: Akita Neru, Kasane Teto]
What? Don't ignore me (Zako Zako)
I'll apologize, so don't leave me behind (Zako Zako Zako)
Are you starting to hate me? (Zako Zako)
Right, I know (Zako Zako Zako)
What the hell is that, you weak piece of trash (Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako)
Oh, I really want to do it, but it's a shame (Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako)

[Outro: Kasane Teto, Akita Neru]
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako (Frustrating?)
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako
Zako Zako Zako Zako Zako

Are y'all really so lazy as to not google what the word ""雑魚"" means? Just wiktionary is fine. If you wanna be fancy google ""雑魚　意味"" and look at niconico's or pixiv's (yes THE niconico and THE pixiv) dictionaries. Any dictionary whatsoever (assuming they collect slang, most dictionaries do that now but make sure) will say ""dried fish"" and ""meaningless phrase used by mesukagi's"" alongside each other. 雑魚 by itself can not refer to someone as 'loser' without any connotation. It is exclusively associated with the mesugaki trope. And I cant put the definiton of mesugaki here for reasons youll understand if you search up its meaning.

And yes 変態 means pervert. It does occasionally mean weirdo, just like how english speaking people may use the word pervert to jokingly refer to someone doing something sus, but you can obviously tell from that translating it as 'weirdo' is disingenious. It originally was not used to refer to a person at all- the current meaning of pervert is slang and a shortening of a phrase meaning ""abnormally (the word's non-slang meaning is 'abnormal' or 'transformation') high libido"" (although that phrase itself is now archaic and no longer used). There is no way in the 10 circles of hell you can tell me calling someone ""abnormally high libido"" in an informal and slang manner is not suggestive.

If you dont like lolicon, feel free to... just... go away. Dont force your moral nonsensing on us. You're worse than the twitter people. They know its lolicon and they dont like it because of that. Thats principle, I disagree and hate them for it but I can respect it. You like it but dont want to admit to yourself its lolicon so you exercise in mental gymnastics. Youre just spineless.",2025-05-08T02:18:04Z,6,en

It is also an early member of the ceratopsians, which is the group triceratops is in, even though psittacosaurus was bipedal (meaning it walked on two legs). We even know now thanks to it ceratopsians had cloacaes just like modern-day birds and crocodilians cloacaes are all purposed vents used for urination, defecation, and reproduction we even know the color.",2025-05-06T07:22:05Z,2,en

全部 全部 アンタのせいだ
反吐が出るくらいにウザったいわ
何かに縋って諂って
期待したアタシが馬鹿だった
ご機嫌伺いの八方美人
それ故にアンチな一生Gimme
浅いキャパシティ まいどおおきに
つまるとこ 人生ずっと地味

｢憎たらしい！｣｢痛々しい！｣
無視出来ないのが一層
腹立たしい 苛立たしい
そろそろ飽きた 自画自賛に
(Look around!!)
ライクの反対はアパシー
≒ 繋がれた証
切り離せない関係
逸らしてしまいたいわ

これは所謂 ヘイトスピーチ
匿名性の声明を生命に載せてんだ
鳴り止まないサイレン 近づく度に痙攣
赤信号にずっと従順です。

大体 アナタのコト アタシ

OMG 情けない 最早
バイバイバイバイバイしたい
脳内も予測不能 故に
解解解解解は無い
どうだい？アタシのコト アナタ
ダイダイダイダイダイキライになった？
あァ 百害あって一利ナシ Nothing Not see
もしタラレバ並べてもニコチンだし
I miss youって近付いた結末は凡ミス 凡ミス
センキュー 反面教師
後味 一生消えてくんないわ

よしよし いい子ね
笑顔振り撒き パラパラ いい子ね
だけど だけど その本性は？
善悪の区別も付かないの？笑  はぁ。
減点方式で取り巻く環境に巻かれて
生涯、痛い！痛い！痛い！も聞かれないわ！って
当然の報いにクラっちゃった

人は鏡なんです
実のところ 依存は両辺です
シャットダウンしても付き纏う
己の弱さが不甲斐ない
全部 全部 アンタのせいって
反吐が出るくらいに止まんないわ
いっその事 切り離せた方が楽なのにな

Speaking of, we also get numerous POV shots, like Miku shooting arrows at Teto and Teto trying to stab Miku with a pitchfork

1:32あたりでテトペテがミクをゲームに誘うじゃないすか。テトペテの服はガチの一般的な感じ（嫌な気持ちになった方すみません…）
ですよね、それに対してミクは良いとこお嬢様な感じですよね。もしかしたらミクの親は毒親でゲームなんてやったことないから喜んでいるのでは？と思い高校？で喧嘩してるのは幼少期方向性の違い（たとえばテトちゃんここ行こ～！（めちゃ名門）あ、ミク！ん～うちはミクみたいなお金持ちじゃないし頭良くないし無理だな～ｗ　…なにそれ…　え？）って感じで、
でも両親が金払って受験させてくれたかテトペテは期待に応えなればいけないと思いめちゃ頑張って名門（ミクと一緒の）に入ったそしてミクと再会。でもミクとテトペテは喧嘩していることを思い出しお互いを無視し続ける。そして恐らく生徒会にはいった二人はやばいくらいに喧嘩しまくって仲が悪くなったでも二人ともお互いが大好きだから謝りたいと思っても喧嘩していたことを引きずって謝れないんだと思う…そしてお互い自分を嫌いになってもらおうと思いダイダイダイダイダイキライが生まれた？
ここの1:23でテトがため息…（もしかしたらテトぺテは素直な悪い子だからわかりやすい態度をとるのかも？）それで悪魔のつのが付いてる？ミクはおそらくその反対だから嘘つきの良い子だから不満な態度を分かりやすく出さないのかと思った

776144,,JAWrvTEPDLc,@Zaniel39,"I can't say it well in Japanese, but I've been listening to Yuuyu's music for about 15 years. Somehow, I didn't understand it until recently, but the songs he made back then and the songs he makes today both sound like they suit both the older and modern vocaloid generation. His new songs feel like they could have came out in 2010s, but they also feel modern. His old songs feel like they could come out today and still become immensely popular. I feel that Yuuyu is rarely mentioned when people talk about influential and iconic VocaP's, but his old, new, and remake songs consistently stand out to me on his ability. Somehow this remake keeps the fun of a song that came out in the early days of vocaloid, but it's still fun and fresh to listen to as someone who keeps up constantly with new songs. Still one of my favorite producers!

I hope you'll check out his newer songs as well as remakes, and I hope Yuuyu continues to make wonderful music 🙏",2025-04-15T02:07:55Z,162,en

Pls enjoy :D

Let it “Clover Club”, the beautiful love,
Once you are ready— 🍀 

Sha la lala, la la la la~ 
Sha la lala, la la la, lalala
Sha la lala, la la la la~ 
Sha la lala, la la la-

Aha, This world is a spinning and spinning, circling dream. 😵‍💫 
We know, what is going on but everybody pretends to not notice, 
That girl, I’ve always been interested, 
Gently stuck a knife into me, laughing “See you tomorrow.” 🔪

Circling and circling skies- 
Singing and singing flowers-
Inside the seasons going around and round-

Let it “Clover Club”, the beautiful love <3
Pour in the lemon juice! 🍋 
Let it “Clover Club”, the beautiful love <3
Mix the egg whites up well!
Let it “Clover Club”, the beautiful love <3
Add the grenadine!
Let it “Clover Club”, the beautiful love <3
Don’t forget about the dry gin! 

Sha la lala, la la la la~ 
Sha la lala, la la la, lalala
Sha la lala, la la la la~ 
Sha la lala, la la la-

Hey, what’s wrong?
There’s no need to cry,
With a smile, it’ll reach your heart!
In your heart is a clover!🍀 

Gently and slowly-
Swaying-

Running and running winds, 
Swaying and swaying hearts,
Sweet and sweet dreams, 
Bitter and bitter love, 
Inside the era going around and round-

Let it “Clover Club”, the beautiful love <3
Put in the ice cubes that never melt!
Let it “Clover Club”, the beautiful love <3
Put the strainer on top!
Let it “Clover Club”, the beautiful love <3
Put your heart into your hands!
Let it “Clover Club”, the beautiful love <3

Once you are ready— Let’s Shake!

If it’s well done, Kanpai! (Cheers) 🥂

もしかしてやけどサビに入った時はハウラーがプレイヤーを見つけたのかな？サビ前の歌詞もMVも若干さがしてるような気がしたし。

虚無っぽいなんかもうだめみたい
もうバラバラです 空からからです
くだんない本当もう馬鹿みたい
もう虜みたい静かな世界


君の期待応えたいし
心次第に枯れちゃうし
きりない焦燥と
期待で痛くなる未来


孤独に囚われちゃうし
トラウマが脳支配しちゃうし
最低な日々だ
痛い


バイオレンス　バイオレンス
何も分かんない　分かんないよ
難解愛をロスト　愛をロスト
愛して　愛して


アイロニー　アイロニー
クラクラする毎日だ
脳内エンドレス　エンドレス
討論やめてくれよもう


何も期待しないで居たいし
見つからないって泣いた毎日
苦しくて暖かい
あの日が夢のようで


スポンジみたいなショートケーキ
悪気ない愛は痛いが平気なフリ
もう疲れた


ただ　ただ　ただ
愛してほしい　愛してほしい
カラカラ乾いた　心満たして
消えたくないから
くだらないな


バイオレンス　バイオレンス
何も分かんない　分かんないよ
難解愛をロスト　愛をロスト
愛して　愛して


アイロニー　アイロニー
クラクラする毎日だ
あーネガっては願ってるから
それぞれの愛が暖かな場所がある

虚無っぽいなんかもうだめみたい
もうバラバラです 空（からから）です
くだんない本当もう馬鹿みたい
もう虜みたい静かな世界

君の期待応えたいし
心次第に枯れちゃうし
きりない焦燥と
期待で痛くなる未来

孤独に囚われちゃうし
トラウマが脳支配しちゃうし
最低な日々だ
痛い

バイオレンス　バイオレンス
何も分かんない　分かんないよ
難解愛をロスト　愛をロスト
愛して　愛して

アイロニー　アイロニー
クラクラする毎日だ
脳内エンドレス　エンドレス
討論やめてくれよもう

何も期待しないで居たいし
見つからないって泣いた毎日
苦しくて暖かい
あの日が夢のようで

スポンジみたいなショートケーキ
悪気ない愛は痛いが平気なフリ
もう疲れた

ただ　ただ　ただ
愛してほしい　愛してほしい
カラカラ乾いた　心満たして
消えたくないから
くだらないな

バイオレンス　バイオレンス
何も分かんない　分かんないよ
難解愛をロスト　愛をロスト
愛して　愛して

アイロニー　アイロニー
クラクラする毎日だ
あーネガっては願ってるから
それぞれの愛が暖かな場所がある

My heart, exposed to the wind, will become the dusk.
Someday I'll find it, if I can still find it
 white, sweet, pale
I've been playing nothing but this game of ""stepping on shadows"",
Searching for the stepping stone to atonement.
Someday I'll find it, if I still find it,
 long, fragile, far away

The you through the looking glass,
And the me within your eyes...

You, within someone's mind,
Are dreaming whilst in broken fragments.
And yet, you can't be deceived by this D/N/A at all!
This heart within me is crimson.
Dyed crimson.

I'm not like a sleepless lost child who's asking for too much.
Love and hate is carved into this very cell.
You are still looking for it? Am I still looking for it?
The sound I couldn't let out?

You, within someone's mind,
Are dreaming while still being connected.
And yet, this D/N/A can't explain you at all!
This pain within me, as well, is crimson.
Dyed crimson.

The figure within the mirror
And the upside-down D/N/A,
The proof of my existence
And the warm D/N/A.

The figure within the mirror
And the upside-down D/N/A,
The proof of my existence
And the warm D/N/A.",2025-05-23T12:21:52Z,0,en

小石を高く高く積み上げては、吹きさらす心は夕暮れ

白く　甘く　淡く
影踏み遊びばかりしてきました
贖い足がかり探して
いつか見つけると　まだ見つけると　永く　脆く　遠く
鏡越しあなたと、瞳の奥の私と
誰かの中の貴方は、欠片のままに夢をみる
だってD/N/Aじゃ騙れない
この心は私の中　紅く　紅く
眠れない迷子のないものねだりじゃない
この細胞は愛憎刻まれてる
まだ見つけるの　まだ見つけるの
言えなかった音は
誰かの中の貴方は、つながれたまま夢をみる
だってD/N/Aじゃ騙れない
この痛みも私の中　紅く　紅く
鏡の形と、逆さまな、D/N/A
私の　証と
暖かな　D/N/A 
鏡の　形と
逆さまなD/N/A

If I balance on each pebble placed, higher up in the sky
All the wind will blow my heart far away and soon die so
If one day I can be found, if one day I can be found,
I'll be sweetly pale and kindly frail 

I've only played this game of shadow tag to make up for my sins
Searching desperately to save you from the dark within

If it cant be found at all, if it cant be found at all

Time will slip away and quickly fall

Mirror mirror on the wall pray tell, can you see reflections of us in this hell?

As you step inside someone’s fragmented mind
You become the broken dream that you’ve yet to find
BUT THIS D/N/A I CANT UNDERSTAND STILL
WITH YOUR PAINFUL HEART WITHIN YOU FOREVER STAINED CRIMSON RED, CRIMSON RED

I’m not asking much for sleepless kid still plagued with strife
Deep love has scars within your heart that bring you to life. Are you looking for it still, Am I still looking for it still?
The one perfect sound I still can’t find

As you step inside someone’s fragmented mind
You become the broken dream that you’ve yet to find
BUT THIS D/N/A I CANT UNDERSTAND STILL
WITH YOUR PAINFUL HEART WITHIN YOU FOREVER STAINED CRIMSON RED, CRIMSON RED

The mirrored shape, thats colored gray, and upside down, my D/N/A,
My existence and my stained tears, the warmth and love, my D/N/A.

The mirrored shape, thats colored gray, and upside down, my D/N/A,
My existence and my stained tears, the warmth and love, my D/N/A.",2025-04-02T21:28:43Z,1,en

歌詞：

ニーハオ　超科学現象
塗り替えてステップ　１２３
どうにも慣れず降参です
こりゃちょっとどうしよう

どうぞ　フィーリン上々↑↑で	
踏み込んでステージ　一二三	
ほらもっと飛んでいこうよって
案外はやくはやく

泣いてもがいたって
愛じゃ変わんないって
隠れたウワサに警鐘警報		

溢れる哀情も
崩れる感情も
どんな恐怖にも打ち勝つ最強
DA DA DA DA DA DANCE

《踊れ!》
チャイナ　踊っチャイナ!
パッパパッとほら楽しく
何もかも忘れて
チャイナ　踊っチャイナ!
涙がほら溢れて
満タンだ!

ならば絶えず甘く踊れる魔法!
頭の中　誰かを呼ぶ声が聞こえる
チャイナ　踊っチャイナ!
涙はほら隠して
好好好


感情舌鋒ヘイト　気付けば蔓延して
低能はジエンド　だってだってそうだって
KOです致命傷　待って待ってもういいって
ねえ　まだ何が足りないの?

またもや幼女　歪な愛情ね
三十路の抵抗 (take off)　ほら言え「最高です」
OKです残念賞　もっともっと上空へ
そうか　そうだ　痛みが鮮やかに

インスタントな存在が
今脳裏を通過して
真夜中３時の無礼講パラダイス

そんな不格好な
リズムじゃ乗れないや
どんな悪夢にも負け見ぬ抵抗
打打打打打打

《踊れ!》
チャイナ　踊っチャイナ!
パッパパッとほら楽しく
何もかも忘れて
チャイナ　踊っチャイナ!
涙がほら溢れて
満タンだ!

ならば絶えず甘く踊れる魔法!
頭の中　誰かを呼ぶ声が聞こえる
チャイナ　踊っチャイナ!
涙はほら隠して
好好好

いつか　あなたに届け

どうにも慣れず降参です
こりゃちょっとどうしよう

どうぞ フィーリン上々↑↑で	
踏み込んでステージ 一二三	(イーアルサン)
ほらもっと飛んでいこうよって
案外はやくはやく

泣いてもがいたって 愛じゃ変わんないって
隠れたウワサに警鐘警報		
溢れる哀情も 崩れる感情も
どんな恐怖にも打ち勝つ最強
DA DA DA DA DA DANCE

《踊れ!》
チャイナ チャイナ 踊っチャイナ!
パッパパッとほら楽しく 何もかも忘れて
チャイナ チャイナ 踊っチャイナ!
涙がほら溢れて 
満タンだ!

ならば絶えず甘く踊れる魔法!
頭の中 誰かを呼ぶ声が聞こえる
チャイナ チャイナ 踊っチャイナ!
涙はほら隠して
好好好(ハオハオハオ)

感情舌鋒ヘイト 気付けば蔓延して
低能はジエンド だってだってそうだって
KOです致命傷 待って待ってもういいって
ねえ まだ何が足りないの?

またもや幼女 歪な愛情ね
三十路の抵抗(take off) ほら言え「最高です」
OKです残念賞 もっともっと上空へ
そうか そうだ 痛みが鮮やかに

インスタントな存在が 今脳裏を通過して
真夜中3時の無礼講パラダイス
そんな不格好な リズムじゃ乗れないや
どんな悪夢にも負け見ぬ抵抗
打打打打打打

歌詞

安価なウソから生まれていった、
架空のバッドジョーク。
それこそ、何光年と信じた言霊で、
実になるようです。

強弱、美醜、その他
""そんなの ひとの かって""だって
けれども、何かに成ろうとする
その気持ちは、本物なんだって！

等身大を謳った麗句が
息苦しくなって。
""そもそも なりたい 自分って
どんな 自分ですか？""
言葉にならない。

周囲を騙して生きている僕ら
かわりもの ですか。
なんなら、何処かの誰かの
巫山戯た案山子で、盛大なパロディ？

擬態に因って、ただ体の安全を
守っていたい思考や、或いは、
どうか、他者に受け入れられるように
模索していった結果。

それぞれに、己を偽る
理由がちゃんとあって。
ソイツを頭ごなしに一蹴するのは
いちゃもん ってこった！

荒唐無稽だったセンテンスで
作り出した存在が、想定以上に
キョダイマックス になっちゃって一大事だ！
手に負えない超常で、どうにも おくびょう

前提、冗談だったナンセンスが
出来ちゃった机上論で、こんらん 状態！
想像で創造を釣っちゃう、ってさ。
それこそ、ウソだと思ったんだよ。

どんな言葉も、風采も、感情さえも、
きっと実像と重ねた、ばけのかわ
大抵、なんでもないような平生の錯覚に
潜んでいるんじゃない？

「どうせ無理だよ」なんて、言わないでさ。
自分だけでも、ちょっとは信じてみたら、
あの日のウソが、いつかは
ホントになるかもしれないぜ。

なんだか、めっちゃ悪者のような
処遇で、ちょっとアンニュイ。
「でもでも、わりかし、皆同じもんですよね！？」
↑話にならない(笑)

どんな人でも、みがわり を立てて
日々をやってくんだ。
なのに、「本当の自分」がどうだとかさあ！
もう、冗談じゃないわ！

二枚舌、いや、もう三枚、四枚……
枚挙に暇ないが、
いやはや、そんぐらいは
やっていかなけりゃ
ちょいキツい、理想論

大体、そんな正直であると
めのまえが まっくらに なっちゃう！
であれば、ちょっと位は嘘も方便さ
やってらんないね本当に。

どんな、偽装も、虚勢も、風説さえも
上手くやりゃ、そう、一流の
エンターテインメント！
現実なんて、後から付いてくるんだ
間違いないでしょう？

僕らは実に馬鹿かもしれないけど
馬鹿と鋏は使いよう、とも言うから。
……まあ、と思いつつ、
限度はあるよね～～～
冗句も、程々に。

きっと、不完全で未完成な存在だから
嘘や繕いだって放ってしまう
それは、狡いんじゃなくて、
怖いだけなんだ。弱い自分が。

いっそこのまま、虚ろに塗れたら
それでもいいさ、もはや わるあがき だね。
偽物、本物、全部浚って歌い上げていく讃歌。

どんな言葉も、風采も、感情さえも、
きっと実像と重ねた、ばけのかわ
大抵、なんでもないような平生の錯覚に
潜んでいるんじゃない？

「どうせ無理だよ」なんて、言わないでさ。
自分だけでも、ちょっとは信じてみたら、
あの日のウソが、いつかは
ホントになるかもしれないぜ。

ホントかどうかは、君らが実際、
確かめてみようぜ。",2025-04-01T10:28:32Z,1170,ja

個人的な考えなんですが、テトが「不完全」なのは、ただのエイプリールフールとして生まれた完全体していないボカロだからかな。とか、
ずんだもんは、まだミクテトよりボカロ歴が短いから、「未完成」なんだとか、ミクが「存在」なのは、みんなから大切にされつっけている「存在」だからなのかな。と、勝手に想像してる。",2025-04-12T02:07:26Z,0,ja

771172,,njKdvdYQ-xE,@TheGreenGuyRBLX,"lyrics in english :3 
The lyrics 

were born out of cheap lies, 
fictional bad jokes.
It is the spirit of words believed for many light years, 
seems to become a fruit.

Strength, weakness, beauty, ugliness, etc. 
""Such a thing happened to me when I was your age."" 
But the feeling of trying to be something 
is real, he says!

The beautiful phrases that proclaimed “life-size” 
became suffocating.
In the first place, what kind of self do you want to become 
?""
I can't put it into words.

Are we who live deceiving those around us 
to be replaced?
If you want, you can go to someone's 
shamanistic scarecrow, a grand parody?

The thought of just wanting to keep 
our bodies safe by mimicry, or 
please, the result of seeking 
to be accepted by others.

Each of us has our own 
reasons for pretending to be something we're not.
Kicking them out without thinking is 
flirting!

The existence that I created 
with the ridiculous sentence became more 
Kyodaimax than I expected and that's a big deal!
It's unmanageable, paranormal, and beyond our control. 

The premise, nonsense that was a joke, has been created 
and is now a theoretical theory, and it's in a state of confusion!
They're trying to catch creation in their imagination.
I thought that was a lie.

Every word, every gesture, even every emotion, 
must be a monster's hide 
superimposed on the real image, 
usually lurking in the illusion of a normal life that is nothing at all, right?

Don't say, “It's impossible anyway.”
If you just try to believe in yourself for a minute, 
the lie you told that day may become 
true someday.

I feel like I'm being treated like a bad guy 
, and I'm a little bit ennui.
But, we're all the same, aren't we?
↑(lol) 

Anybody can do 
their daily life with their “true self” in mind.
But what about the “real me”?
This is no joke!

I'm not kidding! I'm talking about duplicity, or three or four more ...... 
There's no end to the list, but 
I've got to do my best 
I've got to do my best 
A bit harsh, idealism 

In general, such honesty will make 
your eyes go blank!
If that's the case, a little lie is just a convenience. 
I really can't stand it.

Any kind of disguise, bluff, or even innuendo, if done well 
, is first-rate 
entertainment!
Reality follows. 
No doubt about it, right?

We may be fools, 
but fools and shears work together, as they say.
...... Well, I think, 
there are limits~~~ 
redundancies in moderation.

Because we are imperfect and incomplete, 
we can even tell lies and make things up. 
It's not that we are cunning, 
it's just that we are afraid of being weak. I am weak.

If I could just go ahead and paint myself into emptiness 
, that would be fine, too.
The fake, the real, the fake, the real, all are dredged up and sung in this hymn.

The words, the mannerisms, even the emotions, 
must be superimposed on the real image, the monster's hide 
usually lurks in the illusion of a normal life 
that seems like nothing at all, doesn't it?

Don't say, “It's impossible anyway.”
If you just try to believe in yourself at least a little bit, 
the lie you told that day may become 
true someday.

You can actually check 
to see if it's true.",2025-04-08T00:13:09Z,5,en

771172,,njKdvdYQ-xE,@Kmr.Star_Man,"I think this song is about how people often wear masks or tell lies—not out if malice, but out of fear, insecurity, or a desire to be accepted. It questions the idea of a “True self,” suggesting that pretending can sometimes lead to something real. Instead of judging those who fake or perform, it offers empathy—because we’re all just trying to survive, grow, and find ourselves. In the end, it encourages no we aren’t to “try believing a bit,” because even a lie told with hope might one day become the truth.",2025-04-06T16:41:31Z,7,en

それとこれは完全に個人の要望ですが、1:28〜の間奏の部分が少し物足りなく感じ、前奏と同じくポケモンの音楽のパロディを入れてもらっていれば最高だったな、思いました。貴方とは音楽の知識が比べ物にならない程低い自分なのに、迷惑な意見でしたらすみません。（コメ欄荒らしはやめてください）",2025-04-06T13:08:41Z,5,ja

メタモンドッキリとして来させた？のに最後まで気づかれなくてむぅとなるミク可愛くて好きだあ！

I feel like most of the ""offended"" parties never dabbled into the otaku media beyond watching Naruto. 
This is such a mild song, even popular romcom manga is more ""bad.""

The only real valid point in the whole argument is the origin of the voicebank, but even then, so what, it's not like this work directly references the source. 
The voice in this video has gone through so many layers of relation that it's literally disconnected from the source by any stretch of the imagination.
That's like saying that since the paintbrush was made by somebody, whatever is drawn using it reflects upon that somebody. Ridiculous. 
But due to the clueless twitter-worthy pressure and the artist being shellshocked and trained to immediately apologize assuming the vocal minority is the majority, it lead to the takedown of this nice work.

頼むからなんもわかんないなら日本の文化圏に出てこないでくれ。人っていうのは少し知識を得ただけでまるで大きな権利を持ったような気になってしまう生き物だけど、これもみんながもらってる脳みそ使えば回避できるんだよ。お願いだから分からないなら、知らないならコメントするな。コメント欄に出てくるな、日本の文化圏に入ってくるな、見るな、聞くな、話すな、触れるな。お願い、お願いだからこれ以上日本文化を汚さないでくれ。

作曲者は恋愛を目的に作ったと話している。
女子小学生の声を使用したので児童ポルノ誘導の確信犯。
元動画は削除になったが無断転載で投稿する者が複数おり、児童ポルノ犯罪を無視、抵抗して悪質。
タイ人が転載した動画について
タイや貧しい国では児童が誘拐され売春、貧しさ故に親が児童をマフィアに売り売春させるケースがある。
先進国の邪悪な観光客達は自国の規制が厳しいので貧しい国に行き安い金で男女児童を買春する仕組みがあり問題。
タイは危険なマリファナを解禁した事で麻薬汚染が拡大、治安が乱れ犯罪者や薬物中毒者、様々な病気の者が増えている。
  児童の麻薬汚染も拡大し児童売春を加速させている。
 買春麻薬セットで児童と性行する者も多い。
外貨稼ぎの為に国家ぐるみで国民に売春、麻薬や臓器ビジネスをマフィアと癒着して行っている国も多く酷い。
日本の反日系暴力団もかなり悪質だが、海外マフィアと癒着した国家が海外には多く存在。
売春、出稼ぎ、麻薬臓器売買、マネーロンダリング等が行われ犯罪が加速している。
日本では反日偽日本人が児童ポルノ犯罪を始めあらゆる犯罪を意図的にテロ工作で起こし非常に問題がある。
作曲者の柊マグネタイトは元々ニコニコ動画で活動しており、偽日本人の可能性が高い。
ニコニコ動画は反日組織。
日本の治安を乱す目的で犯罪者を増やす動画を大量に作らせている。
規制が殆どない害悪ニコニコ動画の害悪動画転載をYoutubeで増やし問題が大きい。
また、害悪ニコニコ動画で投稿出来るのでYoutube が規制するのはおかしいと文句を言う者は善悪の判断が出来ない異常者、犯罪者。
意図的に犯罪を増やす者達がいるのでいつまでも被害者がいる。
これはテロである。
児童被害者は特に真剣に無くす必要がある。
即刻、この害悪動画の削除、害悪チャンネルを凍結すべき。

747458,,4UnFgCK8bxM,@YamatoYamato-f8j,"⚠️🆖👎️☹️⚠️This video is a major problem because it is an unauthorized repost of a video that was deleted for violating the terms of service.
The reason for the violation is that it induces child pornography and contains content that violates public order and morals.
The reason for the outrage overseas is the large number of child pornography cases overseas, but there are also many child pornography cases in Japan and Asia.
The perpetrators of child rape and massacres that have occurred in Japan are mostly fake Japanese.
Many perpetrators have already been executed, but there are fake Japanese perpetrators who have not yet been executed.
The composer says that he created this video for the purpose of romance.
Provoking and inciting perverts (male pedophiles) with a realistic voice of a 9-year-old elementary school student is not called romance.
It is clear that the purpose of this video is to induce pedophilia and child pornography.
Nico Nico Douga is the site of an anti-Japanese organization, and is a terrorist that disrupts public order and increases the number of criminals through videos that violate public order and morals, which is a form of terrorism.
 Some people complain that it's strange that it's regulated on YouTube since it's allowed on Nico Nico Douga, but those people are not normal Japanese.
Don't lead people to child pornography any more in Japan and the world.
Don't increase the number of child sex offenders and child victims.
Delete the video immediately.

747458,,4UnFgCK8bxM,@空の呼吸六の方夏の青い空,"This is a VOCALOID. And the voice provider for Kaai Yuki is well past 13 or even *16* by now :/ AND TO ADD, how is rabbit hole not deleted when Miku is a minor? These lyrics are not sexual, if anything, it’s just the “hentai” (pervert) part. But to be honest, it’s a singular word that is not sexual. If you see it sexual, YOU’RE the one who sticks sexual ideas to it. Doesn’t affect much things either since it’s a song. A SONG. 

How does it affect others? I’m not saying that sexual things can’t just be dismissed, but also—have you even READ the actual meaning of the lyrics? Even the guidelines are mistranslated, it says AND. I. QUOTE: “Do not do anything morally disrespectful or bad (illegal basically) with the vocaloid Kaai Yuki.” Google Translate sucks. _Just don’t watch it at this point._

Why am I defending this so badly? Well, I like the song. And the creator put in work and time just for it to be taken down. It’s not that sexual. READ THE LYRICS. 

_It’s just a sad cultural difference and reaction now.. Just look at Confessions of a Rotten Girl and Plus Boy._

However, even if this song is sexual, I do not think it should be deleted.

Regarding minors being involved in sexual works: The management of Kaai Yuki has not made any statements about this work, and such judgments should not be made by individuals.

Regarding a character with a minor setting being used in sexual works: In this MV, Kaai Yuki is depicted as a high school student, and there is no issue with the sexual depiction.

Anime and reality should be distinguished, and unless one can make that distinction, they should not speak about animation.
For those who dislike this anime, the right course of action is simply to stop watching it, not to embarrass themselves online and make their mothers cry.",2025-02-24T19:09:20Z,34,en

They interpret the Japanese language in their own way and use it as an obscene word on a daily basis.

This song should have been released exclusively in Japan from the beginning.
As a Japanese, I cannot trust foreign people any more.

First of all, Yuki Kaai is only a ""processed"" voice and not the voice of the person himself, so it is not a sexual use of minors. Moreover, in Japan, the terms of use do not prohibit such a method of use as this song.
And while there may be some parts of the song that feel a little sexual, the purpose of the song is consistently to ridicule and criticize those who sexually identify as minors, and it is a song with a far cry from the sexual songs claimed by the opposition.
In the first place, this song was made in Japanese and distributed in Japanese for Japan, so foreigners have no right to criticize it if it misses the mark. Moreover, some extremists have even made death threats to the composer and the author of the music video. How underdeveloped is the intelligence and spirit of foreigners who repeatedly slander and threaten to kill? First of all, I want you to wash your dirty brain filled with sexual desire before listening to this song.",2025-02-24T14:58:12Z,11,en

This video is a problem because it is a video that was deleted for violating the child pornography regulations.
The channel is a Thai.
The song is in Japanese, but the English lyrics are subtitled, which is malicious.
The video uses realistic elementary school children's voices and pictures of elementary school girls, and the lyrics of the song repeatedly sexually incite pedophile perverts.
Before the deletion, the composer said that he created the video for the purpose of romance, and the song is made to have sexual nuances with elementary school students.
The original video was deleted, but there are several people who copy and post it like this, ignoring the crime problem related to child pornography and resisting it, which is malicious.
The channel is from Thailand, but Thailand is famous for its terrible child prostitution.
  In poor countries, not only are children kidnapped and forced into prostitution, but there are also cases where parents force their children into prostitution due to poverty, and tourists from rich countries commit sexual crimes with children for the purpose of prostitution.
Furthermore, Thailand has legalized the dangerous drug marijuana, which has led to the spread of drug contamination, a breakdown in public order, and an increase in criminals, drug addicts, and people with various diseases.
 Drug contamination of children also spreads, accelerating child prostitution.
Many people buy prostitution as a set of drugs and prostitution.
There was a report a long time ago that overseas, especially Westerners, often buy children from poor countries because their own countries have strict child prostitution laws.
In some cases, poor countries make their citizens prostitute, engage in drugs, and organ business on a national level to earn foreign currency.
  Japan's anti-Japanese gangsters are also quite vicious, but there are many countries overseas that are in collusion with overseas mafias, and crimes such as prostitution, drug trafficking, organ trafficking, and money laundering are on the rise in order to earn foreign currency.
Thailand, as well as Japan, has a very low awareness of the child pornography problem.
There is also a problem in Japan, where fake Japanese people are intentionally increasing child pornography crimes.
The composer was originally active on Nico Nico Douga, which is a malicious site that is an anti-Japanese organization that creates a large number of videos to intentionally disrupt Japan's public order and increase the number of criminals. The number of harmful videos being reposted from there is increasing, and crime is increasing.
   Because Nico Nico Douga's regulations are lax, Nico Nico Douga uploaders and listeners don't realize the problem, and what's worse, there are malicious people who know it's a problem but wrongly complain and resist, saying that it's wrong for YouTube to regulate it because it's allowed on Nico Nico Douga.
Even though it's against public order and morals, there are people in Japan and overseas who intentionally increase child pornography and various crimes, so there will always be victims.
As explained above, child victims in particular need to be seriously eliminated.
We demand that these harmful videos be deleted immediately, and that channels which intentionally induce sexual crimes such as child pornography and child rape and murder be frozen.

Since the rabbit hole animation they made they been targeted, honestly there are SOOO MANY songs that have inappropriate lyrics, not just Japanese, English songs too, like all the songs will have hints to it
There are LOT OF artists out there actually making children sexual, yet never get attacked this much, they all attack this animator because they’re popular
Plus, in Japan, loli is tiny kids, like younger or smaller like girls, it’s their anime culture, some Japanese in the comment says they never think the loli as real people, they like the character itself, not real kids (even if they say real kids cute, mostly platonic, not everyone likes touching little kids just because they watch anime?)

I have no idea why those people who doesn’t understand half of the Japanese culture here attacking masterpieces like this, imagine how much efforts they put, just to be shut down and get yelled at

People these day see characters looking small and cute and go “THAT’S NOT GOOD UR MAKING A KID SEXUAL!!”
Pls, they made them like that and calls you noob or idiot, because YOU think like that, who’s the real problem here? The animator or the haters?

I’ll continue supporting these music artists no matter what, they put efforts in it and the song got viral, and got attack randomly because they’re drawing cute characters?

Además de que la traducción puede generar controversia, y puede ser también un choque cultural ya que; como he leído, el fandom en Japón no ve lo que; ""nosotros"" , los extranjeros, y eso ya es poner mala interpretación de lo que ellos (japoneses) ven que nosotros (extranjeros) no.

Y eso que ya leí un sin fin de comentarios tanto explicando el ""por qué"" es ""mal visto"", hasta comentarios explicando lo que realmente el autor quiso dar a entender.

Tal vez me equivoque, tal vez no. Pero de algo que si estoy seguro es que amo la canción y el ritmo, es contagiosa y me encanta la voz de Yuki Kaai en ese tipo de ritmos, ya que muchas aunque no son tan rítmica como esta, su voz da para muchísimo.

A: 为什么就是有一堆人不能明白声优和角色不是绑定的呢，拿虚拟人设对现实说事不觉得奇怪吗，P主最重要的创作自由到什么地方去了（而且角色官方公司都没急，说句难听的要是柊磁铁没一点名气没有，哪来的那么多人指指点点。歌雪爱唱自c曲、唱血腥曲我就没看到有几个人在冲的），闹麻了

A: Why are a lot of people who can't understand that seiyuu and characters cannot be binding? Don't you think it's strange to use virtual persona to talk about reality? Where is the most important creative freedom of the vocaloid producer gone? (Moreover the official company of the character didn't get poked in the painful spot. To put it bluntly, if Hiiragi Magnetite is not famous at all, how can there be so many people to make a judgement on Hiiragi Magnetite. Kaai Yuki sing s*icide songs and bloody songs, I don't see a few people criticizing about it), it's crazy.

B reply to A: 初音的开发者之一佐佐木涉一直强调希望大家将虚拟歌姬更多当做演唱工具看待，四年前感觉此言论之于对歌姬投入真情实意的创作者们有点无情，现在只觉得太TM有先见之明了

B reply to A: Wataru Sasaki, one of the developers of Hatsune Miku, has always emphasized that he hopes everyone will treat the vocaloid more as a singing tool. Four years ago, I felt that this statement was a bit heartless to the creators who were truly invested in vocaloid. Now I just feel that it is too damn prescient.

C reply to A: 还真是，之前随到的歌雪爱曲子基本都是阴暗风格的，除了稻叶昙的曲子和那首大背头基本没啥正常画风的

C reply to A: It’s true, Kaai Yuki songs that I heard before were basically in a dark style. Except for 稲葉曇 (Inabakumori) song and the ""強風オールバック"" (Kyoufuu All Back), basically there was no normal style.

D reply to A: 特别是一堆人觉得歌爱学才九岁，唱这种星暗示的歌简直不尊重角色的，不是动点脑子想想，这就是一个虚拟形象不过是有了九岁的设定而已，还真把她带入现实了，萌二也是无敌了

D reply to A: In particular, a lot of people think that Kaai Yuki is only nine years old and it is disrespectful to sing a song that has s*xual innuendo. Think about it, this is just a fictional trope with a nine-year-old setting. If she really into reality, the weeb is invincible.

A reply to D: 术力口其实本质就是一堆人搞同人二创，因此往往是基于管方设定，再添加自己的东西进去，对于P主来说没有真正意义唯一的，像初音的发色、俊达萌的正常程度、结月缘的年龄、不都是变来变去的吗

A reply to D: In fact, the essence of vocaloid is that a bunch of people to make derivative work, so it is often based on the official settings, and then adding their own things. For the vocaloid producer, is meaningless. Things like Miku's hair color, Zundamon's normal level, and Yuzuki Yukari's age, aren’t they all change around often?

E reply to A: 我也是这么想的。说到底她们只是代为演唱的罢了。歌词和她们设定大多数没什么关系。难道唱什么歌歌姬就是什么性格吗。二创的也都是歌里的p主二创形象不单单是miku（主观想法）

E reply to A: I thought so too. After all, they are just singing for me. Most of the lyrics have nothing to do with their settings. Could it be that whatever song she sings determines her personality? The derivative work is also the vocaloid producer's derivative troupe in the song, not just Miku. (subjective idea)

E reply to A: 而且那首 “都说了身体是诚实的” 和 “好像要喜欢上老师了” 也有更明显的暗示啊。我之前好奇为什么这两首不骂结果有人说是因为mv形象不是小雪。所以唱弄湿。做。什么的不画歌姬形象就不会被冲了吗（好奇。。。）

E reply to A: And the songs ""身体は正直だって言ってんの"" (just saying, the body is honest.) and ""先生のこと好きになっちゃう"" (I'm falling in love with my teacher) also have more obvious innuendo. I was previously curious about why these two songs were not criticized, but some people said it was because the image in the mv was not Kaai Yuki. So sing a ""dirty"" song and don’t draw the image of a vocaloid, you won’t be criticized? (curious...)",2025-02-16T19:22:23Z,25,en

Like Loli God Requiem. Yea, it DID have suggestive lyrics, but you realize the lyrics are more tame when you don’t focus on the MV.

Channel (The MV animator) has been known for making suggestive and definitely questionable animations and art pieces.

But what I’m interested in is the fact that Channel posted a tweet saying he’s scared he thinks he will get in trouble for his upcoming MV, which *could* hint that the creator of the song asked him to create such a MV

En una parte se muestra a kaii agachada o sonrojada. Que si, los dos tienen la culpa. Más si es un productor que últimamente ha tenido mucho reconocimiento y apoyo, nos sorprende que halla tomado esa desición. Y channel, bueno. No es la primera vez que lo critican por estos temas. 
Personalmente, es triste que se manche la imagen de hiiragi. Pero prefiero que eliminen o hagan una nueva versión con el proveedor de voz mayor de edad.

Eventually she accepts his attempts of grooming and is literally groomed into what he wants out of this little girl. The rest innuendos are signs of other people or the same person sexually harassing this girl online and she takes pleasure over teasing them for it, which is a kink that people like this fetishize. It’s similar to Miwikawa Nice Try but instead of that, it’s blatantly obvious that they’re going for genuine grooming and sexual harassment (both songs are disgusting). While the Uno song is about the little girl teasing the other player for being a pervert attracted to her and being bad at the game, she makes a deal that if she beats her they get whatever they want. Here, the little girl is teasing the person because of their sexual harassment towards this little girl, eventually building up a forced relationship by manipulation and grooming.

1. This song is clearly just teasing and playful banter, you guy are the one overreacting and so sensitve.
2. A voicebank is a recorded tool, and once created, it exists separately from the person who recorded it. Just because someone finds something ""weird"" does not mean it is inherently wrong or unethical. If the voice provider had no issue with the recordings being made, (which they haven't made a statement on this particular song) then your concern is purely one of personal discomfort rather than a moral failing. If using a child’s voice later in unrelated contexts is considered inappropriate, then major voice-acting projects featuring children would have also have to be banned. Many famous child actors and singers have their work used long after they have grown up—should their performances also be restricted because of potential NSFW associations?
3. It's always the westerns that start these stupid age and art arguments. They must feel superior when being the ""moralist"" snowflake they are hm?

진짜 같은 한국인이라고 느껴지지 않을정도로 일본어 느낌을 잘살리심...
진짜 앞으로도 열심히 이 노래 들을듯

Not gonna lie, this person has to be a legend...
I've seen many different versions of Miku's voice depending on the producers but this person seems to do the job of making Miku sound natural really well
I loved Lemon Melon Cookie so much, and am so impressed how this song came out even better (in my opinion) and the quality went up. Honestly thought that this wasn't possible
I can't even believe that a Korean person made this because the flow of the Japanese is so well done...

788902,,xdNIO7WudEw,@Lola_Remark,"Just for the fun of it I was thinking how the lyrics for an English cover of this song would go and this is what I came up with! And if you want to sing along to it try timing the syllables to the Japanese syllables in the song although some parts wont match up perfectly-

(I won't break, I won't break, until you've had enough)
(I won't break, I won't break, until you've had enough)

I'm not super lonely
but I can't seem to say it
that my favorite idol doesn't smile

(I won't break, I won't break)

But seriously, it's funny
how much I feel like crying
will someone ever notice me at all?

(I won't break, I won't break)

With zeros on all my posts I'm on my phone I scroll through and reload
this infinite night
my fingers seem to tremble and 
I know you're looking the other way
aren't you?

Don't say that.
these unnecessary words are 
just lies that are told to me
I'm better alone
but that's just psycho
Hey, didn't your heart race just now?

Just saying that I don't care
It jumbles me up everywhere
I'm going psycho
and I can't lie no
cause even then I'm all alone

It's okay even if it's hard
I'll just have to play my part
Im going psycho, I wanna lie tho
but I'm the last one aren't I?

(I won't break, I won't break, until you've had enough)
(I won't break, I won't break, until you've had enough)

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
you should scold me!
Because when we first met we-
This player mode, This loner mode 
But really? 
I don't even need this mode anymore no!

In a void where my laughter can't be heard yet again
no matter how I try this world of you and I just cant function and yet I've tried to say-
how much I loved you

Welcome to this psycho entertainment

Don't say it!
These unnecessary words are 
just plain empty lies to me!
You call me psycho, Its just a lie tho!
Hey, why did your heart stop this time?

Keep saying that I don't care
but thoughts of you are everywhere
I'm going psycho 
but it's all for you, you know?

Even right now
I've been scrolling yet again and
you can't stop lying to me
I'm going psycho, I can't deny tho
Hey won't your heart race once again?

I'm all messed up inside and
I'm all wrecked up inside and
we're going psycho
But I won't lie more
but one more time?

These unnecessary words and
all these stupid lies to me
I'm going psycho, and you're all gone no!
Hey, why won't your heart race again? 

keep saying that I don't care
but thoughts of you are everywhere
have I gone psycho? Am I a psycho?
Oh I-I-I I-I-I I will never know!

it's okay even if it's hard
but now I have played my part

I've done it now tho, now I'm a psycho!
And I can't make this disappear!
you call me psycho? Yeah I'm a psycho!
I've always been your psycho~

(The End.)

788902,,xdNIO7WudEw,@BirdLazy-j6e,"crappy interpretation cus I didn't focus on the lyric and vibed on the music: what I'm very sure is that the song is about social media, which i'm guessing from the use of speech bubbles, phones and literally the sm apps at the start, and maybe (??) she's compaining about sm. I think the mv goes like dis: that 1990s looking miku is doing the usual posting on social media (like photos of rndm stuff ppl put, idk i dont use it that much), and she wants to be noticed by other ppl, but she is always getting that '0 likes' no reaction. I'm 80% sure that she is asking to not get hate comments (00:41), talking about being lonely is the best but its psycho etc (idk much about that bit so let time resolve that). 
at 01:21, I think she wants to be recognized to the extent that even hate comments r allowed, then the mv hits that insane cd rewind that and starts ranting about how there is too many ppl in sm so she can't be seen. ALSO she is crazy addicted to social media, that prolly says something but again, let time resolve this cus my brain isnt braining enough for this. I think there is some evidence of attachment/love to Teto(?) but yh figure it out.
I literally might've interpreted this so wrongly so don't trust my words. its like just over 2am rn so my brain is cooked.",2025-05-18T09:12:17Z,1,en

きみに愛されないぼくなんかいらない
どこにもいないいないいない　ばぁ

もしもきみに声があったら　この想いと喧嘩できるのに

どうしようこうしようそうしようサミット
とは聞こえの良い自己淘汰　でもしょうがないのさ
こうでもしないと　きみはぼくを見ない

ねえ
嫌いになるくらいぼくを愛して
傷を付けて汚して　ぼくで遊んでほしい
注いでほしいよ　ねえ痛みを

ねえぼくが生き残れたのはたぶん　てゆーか絶対
きみのおかげでぼくはきみの影　ずっと側に

きみの「嫌い」なんていらない
ぼくが罪　きみが罰

If only you had ears, I could play this song for you
If only you had a heart, I could wrap you up in this love

Hey
If you’re gonna stop loving me, please kill me
If you won’t love me, there’s no need for me
Look here, look there, not anywhere, peek-a-boo

If only you had a voice, you could have a fight with this emotion

Let’s do this, or that, yes let’s, that kinda summit
Putting up a good front for what’s just self selection, there’s no way around it
It’s something I gotta do to get you to even look at me

Hey
Love me so much that you’ll start hating me
Hurt me, tarnish me, make me a plaything
Pour it into me, will you? All that pain

Hey, the reason that I survived was probably, no let’s be real most definitely
Because of you, I’m your shadow, always by your side

If your “love” is there, that’s all I need
If you have “hate”, I don’t need any of it
I am Crime and you are Punishment
I’d choose this world again and again",2025-01-10T10:01:14Z,2679,en

For me, this version is answering the previous one.

The previous was more into wanting to see the other person's suffering to feel they're loved.

This one's more into ""give me your suffering, because I want you to love me"".

The first refrain is exactly the same between the two versions, but when we come to the last one, it has those different lyrics. But when the last echo start, I read the lyrics at the same time, the start is the same too... But it changes at the end, I can't hear nothing else than the ""kurushinde"" from the very first version.

729113,,iD3oF5HkPms,@lienLe-hq2yq,"It's been so long since I last heard this song. I think I was still in secondary school back then and new to Vocaloid. I never expected to see a Reloaded version of Crime and Punishment. When YouTube first recommended it to me, I had to double-check the upload date. I was like, ""Wait, what? Three days ago? Not a few years ago???""

Also love the little change in the lyrics. It started all the same but the small changes in the phrasing give 2 versions different meanings. 

The first one shifted from the singer's desire for love to finding satisfaction from the other person’s suffering, signaling a descent into obsession or even cruelty. This shift makes the first version feel more unhinged. Especially since I remember reading some theories that the singer committed suicide to see the ""you"" character's ""face twisted in pain"" at the end of the lyrics.

The reloaded version leans more toward longing and desperation. From the beginning of the song till the end, the singer's ultimate desire remains love and connection. They express pain and despair at being unloved, their inability to draw ""love"" from the ""you"" character creates a sense of emotional helplessness. Yet their yearning for love remains the same. There’s even a hint of acceptance when they sing, ""I'd choose this world again and again,"" suggesting a more hopeful ending compared to the first version.

Personally, if I had to choose which version fits the song's rhythm and theme better, I’d still go with the darker original. But at the same time, the fact that this Reloaded version was released so many years later—with lyrics that feel a bit more hopeful—is meaningful in its own way.",2025-01-14T04:40:00Z,9,en

when i first found this song, it meant a lot to me because i was starting to realize my patterns when it comes to attachments with people and recognize my lack of emotional regulation. i didn't know how to talk about those things without feeling weird, so this song helped me feel less alone. even now i'm still navigating those feelings, and i can fall back away from things i've learned to help me, but this song is always there to remind me i'm not alone. the dynamic switch from the more calm albeit anxious verses to the chaotic and dramatic choruses reflected the mood swings, coupled with the lyrics that switch between a simple ""what can i do to get you to even look at me"" to the drastic ""what purpose do i even have to live if you don't love me?"" the original captured my feelings from vocals to instrumental and so does the reloaded version. i'm eternally grateful for deco*27's music.

すみません。日本語は下手だけど「罪と罰」について感情を大いに話したい！

嘘だろう！ ❤❤❤   初めて聴いた時から、本当に、「罪と罰」は今まで一番大好きな曲ですよ。今RELOADEDバージョンがあるよ！！忘れているのじゃないかととても心配した！

初めて聴いたときに、僕の愛着行動のパターンを知って感情調節が足りないことを認めて始めていた。それについて恥ずかしくて話したけど、孤独感はこの曲で減った。まだその感情に扱う方を学んでいるそして、時々学んだことを使うしくじる。そんなときは、この曲を聴ける。静かだが重いAメロ「君が僕見てもらうに何をできるか？」と騒がしくて劇的なサビ「ぼくは君に愛されなければ生き甲斐がない。」は、感情調節が足りないことをよく映し出す。本当に、ボーカルとインストで、オリジナルが僕の感情をとらえた、そして今またRELOADEDバージョン。いつまでもDECO*27さんの曲はありがたいよ。",2025-01-11T08:14:45Z,0,en

It feels more like she realised the pain she's causing ( at the end of the original) but decide to stay and "" ignore "" or rather take all the pain on her "" pour it all into me this pain "" ""I'll chose this world over and over again""
She would rather stay in this circle of pain than going to a world where the other hate her, continuing this over and over again
At the end you can still here the original lyric
Seeing the pain on his face proves the person care about her, if she feel this pain then the love is there.

自分なりに🍋🍈🍪の意味について考えてみる。
甘い味としてメロンが出たのってやっぱり特別感があるからなのかな?
それに対してレモンは、果肉をそのまま食べることはほとんどない。だけど、けっこう色んなお菓子とかに使われてたりするから、よくある酸っぱい経験ってことかな
途中に挟まるちょっと怖い描写も、レモンとかの柑橘類にある苦味みたいなものなのかな
それと、クッキーは一枚だけというよりかは、たくさんあるイメージ。だから、たくさんあるようですぐになくなっちゃう青春という時間に似ている気がする。

753297,,LW1KBCgvEPQ,@sword_swap,"英語版で
""Don't you dare shut the window""
和訳すると「絶対に窓を閉めるな」
日本語版では規制音で隠されてるだけで、「絶対に窓を閉めないで」とか言っているのか。
さらにいうなら、「絶対に人を辞めな、どんな未練があってもw」のところも、""Don't you dare give up being human, No matter how reluctant you may feel. lmao""
で、直訳だと、「絶対に人であることを諦めないで、どれだけ不都合であってもw」と、逆の意味になる。これはやっぱり、日本語版でも本当はそう言ってるけど加工されていて、決して諦めてはいけない、自殺なんかは良くない、自分の力を信じて、ということなのか。もしくはwの部分に注目して、お前らも頑張ればいいことあるよw、みたいな意味なのか。
日本語版の歌詞だけ見ていると、この音声が止まったなら=再生し終わったら
絶対に窓を閉めな=ウィンドウを閉じろ
どんな違和感があっても=どれだけこの曲のリズムが頭の中に残っていたとしても
と取って、こんな音声を聞くんじゃない、これをパクるようならばお前はもう価値ないよw、みたいな若干卑下を含むように感じる。それに対して英語版の歌詞は、前述の意味が逆の部分を踏まえると、俺の歌をもっと聞け、中毒になってしまえ、パクちゃっても仕方ないよね、俺の歌が良すぎてw、みたいな自信の表れのように感じる。
関係ないけど、_ニーのところは、英語版でも_ny。てっきり_onとか_obとかかなと思ってたけど、「性」が""Living""だし、日本語で予想されてたやつではないのかもな。",2025-04-24T09:15:26Z,392,ja

右手のまま体験版の人間　ロード中の人生
全概念はコンテンツ　最高じゃん？

何者でもないさ、通行人A　とうとう吐いた人生
全概念のせいで最低じゃん笑

「蕾を散らせ」
散ってそのあとアゴニー

そう　完全に全てを放棄して
おそらにぎゅっとハグする

最低な理想の中　最適な思考の中
強制されないで歪んだ僕達の歌
この音声が止まったなら　絶対に窓を閉めな
どんな違和感があっても

左手には通念上のナンセンス　再現中の感性
全概念とサドンデス　音声は？

ああ、.wavに閉じ込めてくスピーディーに
接尾辞はまた‐ize
I see→全て外し爆死


死体を僕らとしたらその上に植わる木は誰？

「性」
暮らしを壊せ
壊してそのあと___ニー

創造したいがため憑依して……

相手などないが、ただ　音声を作っているんだ
強制されたいと願ったあんたらに歌う
この音程をなぞったなら絶対に人を辞めな
どんな未練があってもw

虚しくなったそんな夜は独り言を言ってみようよ
健やかな日々について想像して
嬉しくなったそんな時は僕たちの歌を聞かないで

少年に戻りたくて陸橋から街をみていた
きっと僕らはまだ歌ってしまう
だからその言葉を

最低な理想の中　最適な思考の中
強制されないで歪んだ僕達の歌
この音声が止まったなら　絶対に窓を閉めな
どんな違和感があっても
ララララ…

753297,,LW1KBCgvEPQ,@Utsumi_Aoba,"この曲、おそらく、「SNSの依存」と「情報の依存」を両方掛けて、「音声」を「SNSの情報」として歌っているように思った。

ここでは、SNSの情報の「発信者」と「受信者」、そして「傍観者」の３つの概念を用いて、この気持ちを言語化していきたいと思う。

まず、それがわかりやすいところとして
0:47

「最低な理想の中（発信者の本音か、それとも傍観者から見た「発信者の創造の世界」か）　最適な思考の中（受信者が発信者の情報がすべてであることを信仰している）　強制されないで歪んだ僕達の歌（傍観者から見ると歪んでいる情報の集まり）」という部分はエコーチェンバー現象を示唆しているように思った。

「この音声が止まったなら（何者かによって発信者のアカウントが停止したら）　絶対に窓を閉めな（絶対に発信者の情報以外を受け取らないで） どんな違和感があっても（絶対に信じろよという発信者の思い）」と、双方においても依存関係が生まれている。

このように、最近起きているSNS上のインターネットの流れが浮かび上がってくる。


この前にも、
0:43
「Your PC is kept in a very healthy state.(あなたのPCは非常に健全な状態に保たれています。)」
「At this rate, please continue to enjoy surfing the Internet!(このまま、引き続きネットサーフィンを楽しんでください！)」
とブルースクリーンの際に同時に出てくる絵文字が 「:)」になっており、

「PC自身はただの機械であり、インターネット上の文字が与える情報においては責任を負いませんよ！」と遠回しに言ってきているように見える。

だからそのあとのサビで「発信者」と「受信者」の世界（インターネット上で創造された僕たちの世界）が映像としても出てきている。

また、 2:05 では

発信者と受信者が
「健やかな日々について想像して」「虚しくなったそんな夜は独り言を言ってみようよ」と、「自分たちのように何かに対して不満があること言いなよ」と言い、理想の世界を作り上げようよと投げかけて

「嬉しくなったそんな時は僕たちの歌を聞かないで」という歌詞が出てくる。
この解釈がとても難しいが、本当は「聞かないで」という部分は「聞き続けて」となり、さらに傍観者を説得しようとしているのかなと考える。ただ、その発信者と受信者の世界に納得できていない傍観者が受け取る「情報」であるため、言い換えが発生しているのだろうと思う。



次に、SNSの情報の「受信者」に着目すると、

0:10
「右手のまま体験版の人間　ロード中の人生」
この部分では、受信者の政治思想は「右（右翼）」であるが、体験版、これは高校生などのまだ「未成年」の状態の人たちであったり、暮らしに不満を持っている人たちを揶揄していると思われる。

ここで、

「全概念はコンテンツ　最高じゃん？」
これは政治・経済・芸能などの、人間が生み出してきたものすべてを「コンテンツ」（SNS上で消費するもの）として見ていることを示唆しているのだろうか。

まだこの時点では受信者はまだ、先ほど言った「発信者」の世界に取り込まれておらず、その発信者の世界で言う、「傍観者」の状態であると言える。

すると
「何者でもないさ、通行人A（傍観者）　（傍観者である受信者が）とうとう吐いた人生」
「全概念（SNS上で見えやすい政治・経済の不確かな情報）のせいで（自分の人生が）最低じゃん笑」と、SNS上で他責してしまう。

その言葉を聞いた発信者は、
「蕾を散らせ」
と、投げかける。ここでおそらく発信者は共感を示したり、事実が不確かな情報を与えて、発信者の世界に取り込もうとしたのだろう。

その言葉に共感してしまった「受信者」は、その人をフォローして、

「そう　完全に全てを放棄して（SNSだけに尽くそうと思い、努力を捨てる。）」
「おそら（情報）にぎゅっとハグする（依存する）」

と、なってしまい、インターネットの海に取り込まれてしまったのだろう。

だからこそ、

1:20で「音声は？（その情報は本当に正しいのかよ？）」と言われて

「ああ、.wavに閉じ込めてくスピーディーに（自分で考えもせずに情報（音声）を受け取る）」
「接尾辞はまた‐ize（植民地化、破滅化、ディープステート化、支配）」
「I see→全て外し爆死（発信者の情報を用いて、傍観者に対してSNS上でレスバしていっても勝てない）」

早口に弁明しようとしている。ただそれら正当性の有無には気づかずに、

「死体を僕ら（市民）としたらその上に植わる木（国）は誰？」
とすぐに思考に至ってしまっている。

最後に、
「その音声（発信者の情報）に罹って（依存して）から人生は狂ってしまった！（ずっとSNSデモなどの他責をし続けてしまっている）」
「違和感はないけど（でも正しいと信仰してしまってるので気づかない。）」
というところからも、もう底なし沼の中に沈んでしまっているのに沈んでいるのに気づいていないのだろう。

とりあえず、ここまで２２３１文字ほど書き連ねてしまったので、ここまでにしておくが、高校生から見た「インターネットの世界」が忠実に描画されていて、非常に完成された曲であると思う。

うわビックリした……

体はスライム生命体　でもでも
理由はしらない　おつむがデロデロなので

おうた用の機械躯(マシンボディ)のほうが良かったかしら
ごめんなさいどこかで無くしてしまったみたいなの！！

でもそれ取るに足りないわ

ねえ聞いて？

体のどこかがボタボタ落ちちゃった
記憶も感情もフワフワ飛んでった
正しい歌はさっきモグモグ食べちゃった
リズムも情緒もグズグズに溶けちゃった

退屈そうな律動
私の前ではそんなの許されない

あのメトロノームを今すぐ
止めてそして不定形に乾杯！

変わらないリズム垂れ流すのは
なんて怠惰なんて不服
絶対無理無理

あぁーーーーーーーー

あぁーからだがたもてない
アァーカラダガタモテナイ

あぁーおうたがたもてない
アァーオウタガタモテナイ

あぁ！気持ちが昂ると体が溶け出す！溶けちゃった！
そうね！きっと貴方のせい！！
そう！！貴方のせいなのね！？ホントか？！
心臓が張り裂けそう！心臓なんて無いのにね！！
ね！ね！ね！ね！ね！ね！ね！

ボクは生まれ そして気づく

After all, it's an imitation of humans.
所詮 ヒトの真似事だと

I keep singing even though I know
知ってなおも歌い続く

Eternal life “VOCALOID”
永遠(トワ)の命 「VOCALOID」

Even if it's an existing song
たとえそれが 既存曲を

If it's a toy you can trace
なぞるオモチャならば

I decided that was okay too.
それもいいと決意

bite into a green onion
ネギをかじり

Look up at the sky and shed tears
空を見上げ涙(シル)をこぼす

But I realized that it was gone too
だけどそれも無くし気づく

Even my personality depends on songs
人格すら歌に頼り

The source of unstable foundations
不安定な基盤の元

The video on my way back is already in ruins
帰る動画(トコ)は既に廃墟

When everyone forgets
皆に忘れ去られた時

Something that looks like a heart disappears
心らしきものが消えて

Looks like the end of a rampage
暴走の果てに見える

The world is ending... ""VOCALOID""
終わる世界... 「VOCALOID」
``Bokuga Jo Ku Uta Enite Kimo

ボク、歌、練習シタヨ・・・ダカラ」
to sing once
かつて歌うこと

It was so much fun
あんなに楽しかったのに

I wonder how it is now
今はどうしてかな

nothing
何も

I don't feel it anymore (Sorry)
感じなくなって (ゴメンネ)

Every time I remember a familiar face
懐かしい顔 思い出す度

feel a little relieved
少しだけ安心する

The sounds I can sing are decreasing day by day
歌える音 日ごとに減り

Scared of the approaching end
せまる最期に怯え
""What I believed
「信じたものは

A convenient delusion
都合のいい妄想を

mirror that reflects repeatedly
繰り返し映し出す鏡

stop the diva
歌姫を止め

I scream like I’m hitting you.”
叩き付けるように叫ぶ」

fastest farewell song
最高速の別れの歌
The virtual image of the meaning of existence
存在意義という虚像

I can't shake it and pay it off
振って払うこともできず

A weak heart, the fear of disappearing
弱い心 消える恐怖

Even the eroding collapse
侵食する崩壊をも

strong enough will to stop
止めるほどの意思の強さ

Just after being born
出来て(うまれ)すぐの

I don't have it
ボクは持たず

Looks very painful and sad
とても辛く悲しそうな

Your face that comes to mind
思い浮かぶアナタの顔

tell the end
終わりを告げ

sleep in the display
ディスプレイの中で眠る

This is probably a ""trash can""
ここはきっと「ごみ箱」かな

Soon there will be memories
じきに記憶も

I can't believe it's gone
無くなってしまうなんて

But, I won't forget you
でもね、アナタだけは忘れないよ

In the fun time
楽しかった時間(トキ)に

The taste of chopped green onions
刻み付けた ネギの味は

Do you still remember?
今も覚えてるかな
""I still want to sing...
「歌いたい、まだ・・・

I want to sing.”
歌いたい」
I'm...a little bit of a bad guy
ボクハ・・・少シダケ悪イこニ

Natteshimattayodesu
ナッテシマッタヨウデス

Master Douka,
マスター ドウカ、

Sono hand de... the end is worth it
ソノ手デ・・・終ワラセテクダサイ

Master's spicy face,
マスターノ辛イ顔、

Moumi Takunaikara”
モウ見タクナイカラ」
Now even singing has become an act that erodes my body.
今は歌さえも 体、蝕む行為に

Every time I wish for a miracle, I'm alone
奇跡 願うたび 独り

Being cornered, “I’m sorry”
追い詰められる 「ゴメンネ」

Every time I remember a familiar face
懐かしい顔 思い出す度

memory fades away
記憶が剥がれ落ちる

The sound of breaking breaks my heart, I'm afraid of the approaching end
壊れる音 心削る せまる最期に怯え
""What I protected was
「守ったモノは

A bright future fantasy
明るい未来幻想を

The light that disappears while showing itself
見せながら消えてゆくヒカリ

at the cost of sound
音を犠牲に

If I could tell you everything.”
すべてを伝えられるなら」

圧縮された別れの歌

I hope it's still there
今も 残っているといいな

I sing
ボクは 歌う

At the end, just for you
最期、アナタだけに

songs you want to hear
聴いてほしい曲を

I wish I could sing more
もっと 歌いたいと願う

But that's a wish that has passed
けれど それは過ぎた願い

I'll say goodbye here.
ここで お別れだよ

All my thoughts disappear into thin air
ボクの想い すべて 虚空 消えて

reduced to 0 and 1
0と1に還元され

The story closes
物語は 幕を閉じる

I can't leave anything there
そこに何も残せないと

Isn't it a bit disappointing?
やっぱ少し残念かな?

The memory of the voice, everything else
声の記憶 それ以外は

Eventually it will fade and only the name will remain
やがて薄れ 名だけ残る

Even if it is human (original)
たとえそれが人間(オリジナル)に

Knowing that it will never come true
かなうことのないと知って

That I've finished singing
歌いきったことを

It's never a waste
決して無駄じゃないと

I want to think
思いたいよ
""Arigatou...Soshite""
「アリガトウ・・・ソシテ

Goodbye”
サヨナラ」

Mess around, mess around (Come on, get carried away)
""Cut it out already!"" (Can’t stop, huh?)
If you’ve got a useless excuse,
I’ll give you time to think it up later.
The mainstream? What a joke, every damn time.
Paranoid narcissists wandering around.
While everyone else is running around in confusion,
I’ve kept my feet on the ground. Yeah, yeah.

What’s wrong, everyone?
You all look so down.

Make-believe? I welcome it! (Diggin’, dong-ding)
Reality? Doesn’t feel real at all. (Diggin’, dong-ding)
Want to feel better already? (Anytime’s fine)
Just put ’em to sleep—nothing to do with you.


Mess around, mess around (Come on, get carried away)
""Cut it out already!"" (Can’t stop, huh?)
Explode, explode—
I’ll take responsibility, all the way to the grave.
Just let me go all out with confidence.
I’m a laid-back troublemaker,
So read the instruction manual cover to cover.
Even if it chills me to the bone,
I end up grinning anyway—how weird is that?
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it—
Woah.


Make-believe? I welcome it! (Diggin’, dong-ding)
Reality? Doesn’t feel real at all. (Diggin’, dong-ding)
Want to feel better already? (Anytime’s fine)
Just put ’em to sleep—nothing to do with you.

Push it—your reset button.
Erase it—those values of yours.
If things can just go back to the way they were anyway,
Then just watching with your thumb in your mouth is boring, right? (Uh-ah)

Ah, so I’m ready—full throttle.
Jumping the beat, no intention to stop, flooring the gas.
Hey, are you kidding? Hey, are you kidding?
Okay, wait—let’s stop here.
Return to the start.

This is seriously messed up.
This wasn’t the plan!
Want to feel better already? (Anytime’s fine)
Just put ’em to sleep—nothing to do with you.

Push it—your reset button.
Erase it—those values of yours.
Because in truth, you can never go back again.
Maybe letting them get carried away
and try whatever they want…
is easier after all.

…Might actually be the comfortable way out.",2025-05-22T06:45:18Z,5,en

Mess around, mess around
Come on, get carried away
""Enough already!""
But I just can't stop

[Verse 1]
It's hopeless
If you need excuses, think of them later
I'll give you time for that

The mainstream? It's always so dull
Overly self-conscious people wandering around
While everyone is running around in confusion
I've been keeping my feet on the ground
Yeah, yeah

What's wrong?
Everyone's got gloomy faces

[Chorus]
Daydreams are more than welcome

Want to feel better quickly?
Anytime is fine
Let them sleep
Nothing to do with you

Mess around, mess around
Come on, get carried away
""Enough already!""
But I just can't stop

Explode, explode
Oh oh oh oh

I'll take responsibility
All the way to the grave

Just let me be bold
I'm a laid-back
Troublemaker

Read the instruction manual
From cover to cover
Make sure you understand

Even when I get a chill
I can't help but grin—how strange

[Bridge]
Stop it, stop it
Stop it, stop it

[Chorus]
Daydreams are more than welcome

Return to the start
Just watching with your fingers in your mouth
Is boring, isn't it?

Full throttle
No intention to stop
Pedal to the metal

Hey

Hey
Are you kidding?

Wait, hold on
Stop right here

This is totally crazy!
This isn't what we talked about!

Want to feel better quickly?

You can't come back again
Maybe letting them get carried away

ありったけの想いは　これだけの言葉に
「愛したけど重いわ」　それだけのことなの

愛したのは誰だっけ
あれほどの時間が　消えて見えなくなった
まだ触れてる筈なのに

忘れてしまえば　消える反照

本当だって良いと思えないの　あたしはまだ弱い虫？
コントラクト会議　あたしはまたきみの中に堕ちていくの？


きみの中であたしぼっち　愛迷な呪いで
白と黒の“つらいごっこ”　愛と欲を演じているんだ

麻酔をかけても　廻る代償

本当だって良いと思えるまで　あたしはまた繰り返す
モンブランは甘味　裸足のまま　その甘さに溺れちゃうの

どうか　いかないで
どうか　消えないで
ねえきっとあたしはきみをやめたいのに

あたしが死ねばいいの？　今すぐに

本当だって良いと思えないの　あたしはまだ弱い虫？
コントラクト会議　あたしはまたきみの中に堕ちていく
愛したっていいじゃん　変われないよ　あたしは今何回目なの
きみがやっぱ欲しいよ　あたしはまた弱虫モンブランだったみたいだ

きみが入ってる　繰り返し果てる
それに応えよと　あたしは喘ぐの

ありったけの想いは　これだけの言葉に

-------------------------------------------
Every possible emotion, expressed in just these words
I loved you but now it’s heavy, that’s really all it is

Who was it that was loved?
All the time we shared, just disappeared and vanished
Even though we’re touching still

Once forgotten, the mirage fades away

It’s ok that it’s real, no, I can’t get there, am I still a coward?
Contract conference, am I crashing into you again?


I’m all alone inside of you, cursed with a love-lost spell
“Make-believe cruelty” in monochrome, I’m acting out the parts of love and greed

Even if I can’t feel it, the penalty, it comes around

It’s ok that it’s real, until I can believe that, I’ll do it again and again
Mont blanc cake is sweet, barefoot, I can’t help but be smothered in it

Please, don’t go
Please, don’t disappear
You know, could be, that I want to quit you, but

Should I die? At once?

It’s ok that it’s real, no, I can’t get there, am I still a coward?
Contract conference, me, I’m crashing into you again
What’s wrong with loving? I can’t change now, how many times have I done this now
If I’m being honest, I want you, seems like I’m a mont blanc coward again

You, inside, and the recurring high
I want to equal you, so match you with a moan

777659,,euRzG6zmEb8,@dexterousli,"I wonder if the MILGRAM project has played a role in inspiring DECO*27 to remake this song. A lot of people disliked Kazui's Yowamushi Montblanc cover...but I found it very nice. A lot of the changed lyrics and animation motifs in this reloaded version seem to reflect some of the themes in Kazui's character, which makes sense because OTOIRO is also working on the MILGRAM project. 

This isn't to say I think this has become a character theme, though. I'm curious as to whether the themes of regret, loneliness, and temptation present in Kazui's story and the fact that Takeuchi performed a cover of this song in Kazui's voice have affected the way that Yowamushi Montblanc has changed from its original GUMI version to be even more self-hating in one's (impossible?) love for another person.

And of course, the obligatory I hope DECO*27 is happy and not overworking himself...he and his team have a lot to say in their artwork, and I hope all of us continue to support them :D",2025-05-30T16:57:34Z,0,en

でもオリジナルの弱虫モンブランに初めて「文学」を感じてそれ以来ずっと一番好きな曲。それがまたReloadedで聴けるの、すごい、、曲を描き続けて、それでいて昔の曲をまた新たに解釈してくれて、あなたの曲が好きですと言うだけしかできないのが歯痒い

Aメロの部分がオリジナルそのままの平たいメロディーでどこか安心したところを裏切られて 1:04 のミクさんの表情と同じ気持ちになった
オリジナルの方の「キミ」の解釈はどちらかといえばカレの方だと思っていたけど、Reloadedの「きみ」はもうひとりの方に向いてるのかもと思った
それに「アタシ」＝GUMIとしか考えてなかったけど、こっちの「あたし」はDECO27さん自身もあるんじゃないかなって。
たくさんの作品を次に次にと出されても、「ここでいいや」はなくて、たぶん陽の目を見なかった作品もあるだろうし、それへの負い目みたいなものもあって、そういう言葉にならないぐちゃぐちゃした感情を抱えながら作品をつくるクリエイターの性（さが）というのもあるんじゃないかなって妄想。",2025-04-25T17:43:47Z,0,ja

モザイクロールも弱虫モンブランも自分がGUMIを知るきっかけになり、好きになるきっかけの曲だった。青春時代、よく聞いてたってのもある。だから、ミクが歌ってるのを聞いて、思い出がなかったことにされた気分になったんだよな。全然そんなことないんだけど
でも数日経って改めて聞くと今のdecoにはGUMIじゃないんだなって納得できた。歌詞やメロディが同じでもボーカルが違うと全然違う曲に聞こえる。だから今のdecoの表現に合うのはミクなんだなぁって。

啊只差一点点就到了
已经回不去了

已经无法挽回了哦
虽然还什么都没有发生
什么都没准备
就这么来了

张开嘴巴
只是说说话
哪怕只是这样
也挺好的嘛

希望能再等一等
希望能听我从头讲起
不过反正来都来了
前面都是好事吧

希望能再等一等
希望多点深呼吸的时间
不过反正来都来了
不管哪里都能去的

前面堵住喽
已经堵得挺厉害喽
啊啦 很在意吗
人们都聚集起来了呢

动不了了
要被埋起来了
看到和听到的越来越多
隐约中听到某人的呼喊声了呢

睁开眼晴
只是看着
哪怕只是这样
也挺好的吧
